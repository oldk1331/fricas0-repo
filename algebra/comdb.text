2527`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition,{} it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differ

Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivati
2527`--ves is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline
2672`An ordinary differential ring,{} that is,{} a ring with an operation \spadfun{differentiate}. \blankline
2721`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{} ...,{} \spad{y},{} \spad{y'},{}
2721`-- \spad{y''},{} ... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential poly
2721`--nomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define on
2721`--e derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial do
2721`--mains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The additive group of {\em K} becomes
3964`-- a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K},{} \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K},{} {\em c,{} d} from {\em F} and {\em f,{} g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{}

25193`--} of the representation is binary,{} hence a \spad{Record(m: mantissa,{} e: exponent)} represents the number \spad{m * 2 ^ e}. Though it is not assumed that the underlying integers are represented with a binary \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem},{} the code will be most efficient when this is the the case (this is \spad{true} in most implementations of Lisp). The decision to choose the \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} to be binary has some unfortunate consequences. First,{} decimal
25193`-- numbers like 0.3 cannot be represented exactly. Second,{} there is a further loss of accuracy during conversion to decimal for output. To compensate for this,{} if \spad{d} digits of precision are specified,{} \spad{1 + ceiling(log2(10^d))} bits are used. Two numbers that are displayed identically may therefore be not equal. On the other hand,{} a significant efficiency loss would be incurred if we chose to use a decimal \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} when the underlying integer base
25193`-- is binary. \blankline Algorithms used: For the elementary functions,{} the general approach is to apply identities so that the taylor series can be used,{} and,{} so that it will converge within \spad{O( sqrt n )} steps. For example,{} using the identity \spad{exp(x) = exp(x/2)^2},{} we can compute \spad{exp(1/3)} to \spad{n} digits of precision as follows. We have \spad{exp(1/3) = exp(2 ^ (-sqrt s) / 3) ^ (2 ^ sqrt s)}. The taylor series will converge in less than sqrt \spad{n} steps and the
25193`-- exponentiation requires sqrt \spad{n} multiplications for a total of \spad{2 sqrt n} multiplications. Assuming integer multiplication costs \spad{O( n^2 )} the overall running time is \spad{O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}. This approach is the best known approach for precisions up to about 10,{} 000 digits at which point the methods of Brent which are \spad{O( log(n) n^2 )} become competitive. Note also that summing the terms of the taylor series for the elementary functions is done using integer operation
25193`--s. This avoids the overhead of floating point operations and results in efficient code at low precisions. This implementation makes no attempt to reuse storage,{} relying on the underlying system to do \spadgloss{garbage collection}. \spad{I} estimate that the efficiency of this package at low precisions could be improved by a factor of 2 if in-place operations were available. \blankline Running times: in the following,{} \spad{n} is the number of bits of precision \indented{5}{\spad{*},{} \sp

49235`This domain exports a modest implementation of splitting trees.

905745`ErrorFunctions implements error functions callable from the system interpreter. Typically,{} these functions would be called in user functions. The simple forms of the functions take one argument which is either a string (an error message) or a list of strings which all together make up a message.

905745`-- the error was invoked and the second argument is either a string or a list of strings,{} as above. When you use the one argument version in an interpreter function,{} the system will automatically insert the name of the function as the new first argument. Thus in the user interpreter function \indented{2}{\spad{f x == if x < 0 then error "negative argument" else x}} the call to error will actually be of the form \indented{2}{\spad{error("f",{}"negative argument")}} because the interpreter wil

922120`A package for solving polynomial systems with finitely many solutions. The decompositions are given by means of regular triangular sets. The computations use lexicographical Groebner bases. The main operations are \axiomOpFrom{lexTriangular}{LexTriangularPackage} and \axiomOpFrom{squareFreeLexTriangular}{LexTriangularPackage}. The second one provide decompositions by means of square-free regular triangular sets. Both are 
922120`--based on the {\em lexTriangular} method described in [1]. They differ from the algorithm described in [2] by the fact that multiciplities of the roots are not kept.

Both operations admit an optional argument to produce normalized triangular sets. \newline

Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{ev
954638`--al}. A convenient way of referencing derivatives is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline

954899`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{

This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential pol
954899`--ynomial domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}.
954899`-- For example,{} one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives.

For differential polynomial domains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

An element \spad{g} of \spad{G[s]} for some specific \spad{s} in \spad{E} is said to be an element of \spad{G} with {\em degree} \spad{s}. Sums are defined in each module \spad{G[s]} so two elements of \spad{G} have a sum if they have the 
958155`--same degree. \blankline Morphisms can be defined and composed by degree to give the mathematical category of graded modules.
958254`The class of multiplicative groups,{} \spadignore{i.e.} monoids with multiplicative inverses. \blankline
958298`A homogeneous aggregate is an aggregate of elements all of the same type. In the current system,{} all aggregates are homogeneous. Two attributes characterize classes of aggregates. Aggregates from domains with attribute \spadatt{finiteAggregate} have a finite number of members. Of course,{} such a domain may have an infinite number of elements,{} like,{} for example \spadtype{List}. Those domains with attribute \spada
958298`--tt{shallowlyMutable} allow an element to be modified or updated without changing its overall value.
958384`Category for the hyperbolic trigonometric functions.
958471`An indexed aggregate is a many-to-one mapping of indices to entries. For example,{} a one-dimensional-array is an indexed aggregate where the index is an integer. Also,{} a table is an indexed aggregate where the indices and entries may have any type.
958591`This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations. A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make ``evaluation\spad{''} substitutions. The difference between this and \spadtype{Evalable} is that the operations in this category specify the substitution as a pair of arguments rather than as an equation.
958683`An \spad{IntegerNumberSystem} is a model for the integers.
958753`\axiomType{JetBundleBaseFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) of the base space of a jet bundle,{} \spadignore{i.e.} functions depending only on the independent variables. Such a category is needed \spadignore{e.g.} for the representation of solutions.
958870`\axiomType{JetBundleCategory} provides basic data structures and procedures for jet bundles. Nearly all necessary functions are implemented already here. Only the representation and functions which direct access to it must be implemented in a domain. Two notations of derivatives are supported. Default is multi-index notation,{} where the \spad{i}-th entry of the index denotes the number of differentiations taken with respect to \axiom{x^i
958870`--}. In repeated index notation each entry \axiom{\spad{i}} in the index denotes a differentiation with respect to \axiom{x^i}. The choice affects,{} however,{} only in- and output. Internally,{} multi-index notation is used throughout.
958936`\axiomType{JetBundleFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) over a jet bundle. The formal derivative is defined already here. It uses the Jacobi matrix of the functions. The columns of the matrices are enumerated by jet variables. Thus they are represented as a \axiomType{Record} of the matrix and a list of the jet variables. Several simplification routines are impl
958936`--emented already here.
959047`A keyed dictionary is a dictionary of key-entry pairs for which there is a unique entry for each key.
959159`LazyStreamAggregate is the category of streams with lazy evaluation. It is understood that the function 'empty?' will cause lazy evaluation if necessary to determine if there are entries. Functions which call 'empty?',{} \spadignore{e.g.} 'first' and 'rest',{} will also cause lazy evaluation if necessary.
959245`The category of all left algebras over an arbitrary ring.
959312`The category of Lie Algebras. It is used by the following domains of non-commutative algebra: \axiomType{LiePolynomial} and \axiomType{XPBWPolynomial}. \newline Author : Michel Petitot (petitot@lifl.\spad{fr}).
959390`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings,{} lists,{} and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example,{} \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument,{} whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most 
959390`--of the operations exported here apply to infinite objects (\spadignore{e.g.} streams) as well to finite ones. For finite linear aggregates,{} see \spadtype{FiniteLinearAggregate}.
959466`\spad{LinearOrdinaryDifferentialOperatorCategory} is the category of differential operators with coefficients in a ring A with a given derivation. Multiplication of operators corresponds to functional composition: \indented{4}{\spad{(L1 * L2).(f) = L1 L2 f}}
959596`A list aggregate is a model for a linked list data structure. A linked list is a versatile data structure. Insertion and deletion are efficient and searching is a linear operation.

959712`\spadtype{MatrixCategory} is a general matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and colums returned as objects of type Col. A domain belonging to this category will be shallowly mutable. The index of the 'first' row may be obtained by
959712`-- calling the function \spadfun{minRowIndex}. The index of the 'first' column may be obtained by calling the function \spadfun{minColIndex}. The index of the first element of a Row is the same as the index of the first column in a matrix and vice versa.

960859`One-dimensional-array aggregates serves as models for one-dimensional arrays. Categorically,{} these aggregates are finite linear aggregates with the \spadatt{shallowlyMutable} property,{} that is,{} any component of the array may be changed without affecting the identity of the overall array. Array data structures are typically represented by a fixed area in storage and therefore cannot efficiently gro

Iteration over,{} and access to,{} elements of arrays is extremely fast (and often can be optimized to open-code). Insertion and deletion however is generally slow since an entirely new data structure must be created for the result.
960961`Ordered sets which are also rings,{} that is,{} domains where the ring operations are compatible with the ordering. \blankline
961019`The class of totally ordered sets,{} that is,{} sets such that for each pair of elements \spad{(a,{} b)} exactly one of the following relations holds \spad{a<b or a=b or b<a} and the relation is transitive,{} \spadignore{i.e.} \spad{a<b and b<c => a<c}. This order should be the natural order on given structure.

961379`This is the category of domains that know "enough" about themselves in order to factor univariate polynomials over themselves. This will be used in future releases for supporting factorization over finitely generated coefficient fields,{} it is not yet available in the current release of axiom.
961476`A category for finite subsets of a polynomial ring. Such a set is only regarded as a set of polynomials and not identified to the ideal it generates. So two distinct sets may generate the same the ideal. Furthermore,{} for \spad{R} being an integral domain,{} a set of polynomials may be viewed as a representa
961476`--tion of the ideal it generates in the polynomial ring \spad{(R)^(-1) P},{} or the set of its zeros (described for instance by the radical of the previous ideal,{} or a split of the associated affine variety) and so on. So this category provides operations about those different notions.
961674`\spadtype{PowerSeriesCategory} is the most general power series category with exponents in an ordered abelian monoid.
961829`\spadtype{QuaternionCategory} describes the category of quaternions and implements functions that are not representation specific.

962153`The real number system category is intended as a model for the real numbers. The real numbers form an ordered normed field. Note that we have purposely not included \spadtype{DifferentialRing} or the elementary functions (see \spadtype{TranscendentalFunctionCategory}) in the definition.

962427`\spadtype{RectangularMatrixCategory} is a category of matrices of fixed dimensions. The dimensions of the matrix will be parameters of the domain. Domains in this category will be \spad{R}-modules and will be non-mutable.
962666`A recursive aggregate over a type \spad{S} is a model for a a directed graph containing values of type \spad{S}. Recursively,{} a recursive aggregate is a {\em node} consisting of a \spadfun{value} from \spad{S} and 0 or more \spadfun{children} which are recursive aggregates. A node with no children is called a \spadfun{leaf} node. A recursive aggregate may be cyclic for which some operations as noted may go into an infini
962666`--te loop.
962748`A category for general multi-variate polynomials with coefficients in a ring,{} variables in an ordered set,{} and exponents from an ordered abelian monoid,{} with a \axiomOp{sup} operation. When not constant,{} such a polynomial is viewed as a univariate polynomial in its main variable \spad{w}. \spad{r}. \spad{t}. to the total ordering on the elements in 
962748`--the ordered set,{} so that some operations usually defined for univariate polynomials make sense here.
962897`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polyno
962897`--mial ring \spad{k[x1,{} ...,{} xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the sa
962897`--turated ideals of the \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} \spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{
962897`--T}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} is a split of Lazard of 
962897`--\spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline References : \indented{1}{[1] \spad{M}.
