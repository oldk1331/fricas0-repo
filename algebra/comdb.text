2885`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition,{} it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differ

Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivati
2885`--ves is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline
3030`An ordinary differential ring,{} that is,{} a ring with an operation \spadfun{differentiate}. \blankline
3080`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{} ...,{} \spad{y},{} \spad{y'},{}
3080`-- \spad{y''},{} ... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential poly
3080`--nomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define on
3080`--e derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial do
3080`--mains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

3584`An eltable aggregate is one which can be viewed as a function.

27325`\spadtype{Float} implements arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic. The number of significant digits of each operation can be set to an arbitrary value (the default is 20 decimal digits). The operation \spad{float(mantissa,{} exponent,{} \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem})} for integer \spad{mantissa},{} \spad{exponent} specifies the number \spad{mantissa * \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} ^ exponent} The underlying represent
27325`--ation for floats is binary not decimal. The implications of this are described below. \blankline The model adopted is that arithmetic operations are rounded to to nearest unit in the last place,{} that is,{} accurate to within \spad{2^(-\spadfunFrom{bits}{FloatingPointSystem})}. Also,{} the elementary functions and constants are accurate to one unit in the last place. A float is represented as a record of two integers,{} the mantissa and the exponent. The \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem
27325`--} of the representation is binary,{} hence a \spad{Record(m: mantissa,{} e: exponent)} represents the number \spad{m * 2 ^ e}. Though it is not assumed that the underlying integers are represented with a binary \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem},{} the code will be most efficient when this is the the case (this is \spad{true} in most implementations of Lisp). The decision to choose the \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} to be binary has some unfortunate consequences. First,{} decimal
27325`-- numbers like 0.3 cannot be represented exactly. Second,{} there is a further loss of accuracy during conversion to decimal for output. To compensate for this,{} if \spad{d} digits of precision are specified,{} \spad{1 + ceiling(log2(10^d))} bits are used. Two numbers that are displayed identically may therefore be not equal. On the other hand,{} a significant efficiency loss would be incurred if we chose to use a decimal \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} when the underlying integer base
27325`-- is binary. \blankline Algorithms used: For the elementary functions,{} the general approach is to apply identities so that the taylor series can be used,{} and,{} so that it will converge within \spad{O( sqrt n )} steps. For example,{} using the identity \spad{exp(x) = exp(x/2)^2},{} we can compute \spad{exp(1/3)} to \spad{n} digits of precision as follows. We have \spad{exp(1/3) = exp(2 ^ (-sqrt s) / 3) ^ (2 ^ sqrt s)}. The taylor series will converge in less than sqrt \spad{n} steps and the
27325`-- exponentiation requires sqrt \spad{n} multiplications for a total of \spad{2 sqrt n} multiplications. Assuming integer multiplication costs \spad{O( n^2 )} the overall running time is \spad{O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}. This approach is the best known approach for precisions up to about 10,{} 000 digits at which point the methods of Brent which are \spad{O( log(n) n^2 )} become competitive. Note also that summing the terms of the taylor series for the elementary functions is done using integer operation
27325`--s. This avoids the overhead of floating point operations and results in efficient code at low precisions. This implementation makes no attempt to reuse storage,{} relying on the underlying system to do \spadgloss{garbage collection}. \spad{I} estimate that the efficiency of this package at low precisions could be improved by a factor of 2 if in-place operations were available. \blankline Running times: in the following,{} \spad{n} is the number of bits of precision \indented{5}{\spad{*},{} \sp

52463`This domain exports a modest implementation of splitting trees. Splitting trees are needed when the evaluation of some quantity under some hypothesis requires to split the hypothesis into sub-cases.

1012742`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates.

1013003`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{

This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential pol
1013003`--ynomial domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}.
1013003`-- For example,{} one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives.

For differential polynomial domains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

Recursively,{} a recursive aggregate is either empty or a {\em node} consisting of a \spadfun{value} from \spad{S} and 0 or more \spadfun{children} which are recursive aggregates.

1021248`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polyno
1021248`--mial ring \spad{k[x1,{} ...,{} xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the sa
1021248`--turated ideals of the \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} \spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{
1021248`--T}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} is a split of Lazard of 
1021248`--\spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline

1021635`A set category lists a collection of set-theoretic operations useful for both finite sets and multisets. Note however that finite sets are distinct from multisets. Although the operations defined for set categories are common to both,{} the relationship between the two cannot be described by inclusion or inheritance.
1021713`\spadtype{SetCategory} is the basic category for describing a collection of elements with \spadop{=} (equality) and \spadfun{coerce} to output form. \blankline Conditional Attributes: \indented{3}{canonical\tab{15}data structure equality is the same as \spadop{=}}
1021770`PointCategory is the category of points and vectors in space. Points may be used to represent shapes in a scenegraph such as: the vertices of a cube or points along a line.

1022797`The category of triangular sets of multivariate polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain. Let \spad{R} be an integral domain and \spad{V} a finite ordered set of variables,{} say \spad{X1 < X2 < ... < Xn}. A set \spad{S} of polynomials in \spad{R[X1,{} X2,{} ...,{} Xn]} is triangular if no elements of \spad{
1022797`--S} lies in \spad{R},{} and if two distinct elements of \spad{S} have distinct main variables. Note that the empty set is a triangular set. A triangular set is not necessarily a (lexicographical) Groebner basis and the notion of reduction related to triangular sets is based on the recursive view of polynomials. We recall this notion here and refer to [1] for more details. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a non-constant polynomial \spad{Q} if the degree of \spad{P} in 
1022797`--the main variable of \spad{Q} is less than the main degree of \spad{Q}. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a triangular set \spad{T} if it is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. every polynomial of \spad{T}. \newline

1023261`A unary-recursive aggregate is an aggregate where nodes may have either 0 or 1 children. This aggregate models,{} though not precisely,{} a linked list possibly with a single cycle. A node with one children models a non-empty list,{} with the \spadfun{value} of the list designating the head,{} or \spadfun{first},{} of the list,{} and the child designating the tail,{} or \spadfun{rest},{} of the list. A node with
