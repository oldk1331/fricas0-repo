2527`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition,{} it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differ

Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivati
2527`--ves is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline
2672`An ordinary differential ring,{} that is,{} a ring with an operation \spadfun{differentiate}. \blankline
2721`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{} ...,{} \spad{y},{} \spad{y'},{}
2721`-- \spad{y''},{} ... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential poly
2721`--nomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define on
2721`--e derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial do
2721`--mains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The additive group of {\em K} becomes
3947`-- a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K},{} \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K},{} {\em c,{} d} from {\em F} and {\em f,{} g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{}

25610`\spadtype{Float} implements arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic. The number of significant digits of each operation can be set to an arbitrary value (the default is 20 decimal digits). The operation \spad{float(mantissa,{} exponent,{} \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem})} for integer \spad{mantissa},{} \spad{exponent} specifies the number \spad{mantissa * \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} ^ exponent} The underlying represent
25610`--ation for floats is binary not decimal. The implications of this are described below. \blankline The model adopted is that arithmetic operations are rounded to to nearest unit in the last place,{} that is,{} accurate to within \spad{2^(-\spadfunFrom{bits}{FloatingPointSystem})}. Also,{} the elementary functions and constants are accurate to one unit in the last place. A float is represented as a record of two integers,{} the mantissa and the exponent. The \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem
25610`--} of the representation is binary,{} hence a \spad{Record(m: mantissa,{} e: exponent)} represents the number \spad{m * 2 ^ e}. Though it is not assumed that the underlying integers are represented with a binary \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem},{} the code will be most efficient when this is the the case (this is \spad{true} in most implementations of Lisp). The decision to choose the \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} to be binary has some unfortunate consequences. First,{} decimal
25610`-- numbers like 0.3 cannot be represented exactly. Second,{} there is a further loss of accuracy during conversion to decimal for output. To compensate for this,{} if \spad{d} digits of precision are specified,{} \spad{1 + ceiling(log2(10^d))} bits are used. Two numbers that are displayed identically may therefore be not equal. On the other hand,{} a significant efficiency loss would be incurred if we chose to use a decimal \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} when the underlying integer base
25610`-- is binary. \blankline Algorithms used: For the elementary functions,{} the general approach is to apply identities so that the taylor series can be used,{} and,{} so that it will converge within \spad{O( sqrt n )} steps. For example,{} using the identity \spad{exp(x) = exp(x/2)^2},{} we can compute \spad{exp(1/3)} to \spad{n} digits of precision as follows. We have \spad{exp(1/3) = exp(2 ^ (-sqrt s) / 3) ^ (2 ^ sqrt s)}. The taylor series will converge in less than sqrt \spad{n} steps and the
25610`-- exponentiation requires sqrt \spad{n} multiplications for a total of \spad{2 sqrt n} multiplications. Assuming integer multiplication costs \spad{O( n^2 )} the overall running time is \spad{O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}. This approach is the best known approach for precisions up to about 10,{} 000 digits at which point the methods of Brent which are \spad{O( log(n) n^2 )} become competitive. Note also that summing the terms of the taylor series for the elementary functions is done using integer operation

947930`This package \undocumented
948155`Package for the determination of the coefficients in the lifting process. Used by \spadtype{MultivariateLifting}. This package will work for every integral domain \spad{R} which has property \spad{F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} there exists a factor operation in \spad{R[x]}.
948321`In this package \spad{F} is a framed algebra over the integers (typically \spad{F = Z[a]} for some algebraic integer a). The package provides functions to compute the integral closure of \spad{Z} in the quotient quotient field of \spad{F}.
948449`NumberFormats provides function to format and read arabic and roman numbers,{} to convert numbers to strings and to read floating-point numbers.
948492`This package provides polynomials as functions on a ring.
948575`Numeric provides real and complex numerical evaluation functions for various symbolic types.
948636`This package is a suite of functions for the numerical integration of an ordinary differential equation of \spad{n} variables: \blankline \indented{8}{\center{dy/dx = \spad{f}(\spad{y},{} \spad{x})\space{5}\spad{y} is an \spad{n}-vector}} \blankline \par All the routines are based on a 4-th order Runge-Kutta kernel. These routines generally have as arguments: \spad{n},{} the number of dependent variables; \spad{x1},{} the initial point;
948636`-- \spad{h},{} the step size; \spad{y},{} a vector of initial conditions of length \spad{n} which upon exit contains the solution at \spad{x1 + h}; \spad{derivs},{} a function which computes the right hand side of the ordinary differential equation: \spad{derivs(dydx,{} y,{} x)} computes \spad{dydx},{} a vector which contains the derivative information. \blankline \par In order of increasing complexity: \begin{items} \blankline \item \spad{rk4(y,{} n,{} x1,{} h,{} derivs)} advances the solution 
948636`--vector to \spad{x1 + h} and return the values in \spad{y}. \blankline \item \spad{rk4(y,{} n,{} x1,{} h,{} derivs,{} t1,{} t2,{} t3,{} t4)} is the same as \spad{rk4(y,{} n,{} x1,{} h,{} derivs)} except that you must provide 4 scratch arrays \spad{t1}-\spad{t4} of size \spad{n}. \blankline \item Starting with \spad{y} at \spad{x1},{} \spad{rk4f(y,{} n,{} x1,{} x2,{} ns,{} derivs)} uses \spad{ns} fixed steps of a 4-th order Runge-Kutta integrator to advance the solution vector to \spad{x2} and r
948636`--eturn the values in \spad{y}. Argument \spad{x2},{} is the final point,{} and \spad{ns},{} the number of steps to take. \blankline \item \spad{rk4qc(y,{} n,{} x1,{} step,{} eps,{} yscal,{} derivs)} takes a 5-th order Runge-Kutta step with monitoring of local truncation to ensure accuracy and adjust stepsize. The function takes two half steps and one full step and scales the difference in solutions at the final point. If the error is within \spad{eps},{} the step is taken and the result is retu
948636`--rned. If the error is not within \spad{eps},{} the stepsize if decreased and the procedure is tried again until the desired accuracy is reached. Upon input,{} an trial step size must be given and upon return,{} an estimate of the next step size to use is returned as well as the step size which produced the desired accuracy. The scaled error is computed as \center{\spad{error = MAX(ABS((y2steps(i) - y1step(i))/yscal(i)))}} and this is compared against \spad{eps}. If this is greater than \spad{e
948636`--ps},{} the step size is reduced accordingly to \center{\spad{hnew = 0.9 * hdid * (error/eps)^(-1/4)}} If the error criterion is satisfied,{} then we check if the step size was too fine and return a more efficient one. If \spad{error > \spad{eps} * (6.0E-04)} then the next step size should be \center{\spad{hnext = 0.9 * hdid * (error/\spad{eps})^(\spad{-1/5})}} Otherwise \spad{hnext = 4.0 * hdid} is returned. A more detailed discussion of this and related topics can be found in the book "Numeri
948636`--cal Recipies" by \spad{W}.Press,{} \spad{B}.\spad{P}. Flannery,{} \spad{S}.A. Teukolsky,{} \spad{W}.\spad{T}. Vetterling published by Cambridge University Press. Argument \spad{step} is a record of 3 floating point numbers \spad{(to_try ,{} did ,{} next)},{} \spad{eps} is the required accuracy,{} \spad{yscal} is the scaling vector for the difference in solutions. On input,{} \spad{step.to_try} should be the guess at a step size to achieve the accuracy. On output,{} \spad{step.did} contains the
948636`-- step size which achieved the accuracy and \spad{step.next} is the next step size to use. \blankline \item \spad{rk4qc(y,{} n,{} x1,{} step,{} eps,{} yscal,{} derivs,{} t1,{} t2,{} t3,{} t4,{} t5,{} t6,{} t7)} is the same as \spad{rk4qc(y,{} n,{} x1,{} step,{} eps,{} yscal,{} derivs)} except that the user must provide the 7 scratch arrays \spad{t1-t7} of size \spad{n}. \blankline \item \spad{rk4a(y,{} n,{} x1,{} x2,{} eps,{} h,{} ns,{} derivs)} is a driver program which uses \spad{rk4qc} to in
948636`--tegrate \spad{n} ordinary differential equations starting at \spad{x1} to \spad{x2},{} keeping the local truncation error to within \spad{eps} by changing the local step size. The scaling vector is defined as \center{\spad{yscal(i) = abs(y(i)) + abs(h*dydx(i)) + tiny}} where \spad{y(i)} is the solution at location \spad{x},{} \spad{dydx} is the ordinary differential equation\spad{'s} right hand side,{} \spad{h} is the current step size and \spad{tiny} is 10 times the smallest positive number r
948636`--epresentable. The user must supply an estimate for a trial step size and the maximum number of calls to \spad{rk4qc} to use. Argument \spad{x2} is the final point,{} \spad{eps} is local truncation,{} \spad{ns} is the maximum number of call to \spad{rk4qc} to use. \end{items}
948704`This suite of routines performs numerical quadrature using algorithms derived from the basic trapezoidal rule. Because the error term of this rule contains only even powers of the step size (for open and closed versions),{} fast convergence can be obtained if the integrand is sufficiently smooth. \blankline Each routine returns a Record of type TrapAns,{} which contains\indent{3} \newline value (\spadtype{Float}): \tab{20} estimate of the integral \newli

Convergence is obtained when either \center{\spad{ABS(S(i) - S(i-1)) < eps_r * ABS(S(i-1))}} \center{or \spad{ABS(S(i) - S(i-1)) < eps_a}} are \spad{true} statements. \blankline The routines come in three families and three flavors: \newline\tab{3} closed: \tab{20}romberg,{} \tab{30}simpson,{} \tab{42}trapezoidal \newline\tab{3} open: \tab{20}rombergo,{} \tab{30}simpsono,{} \tab{42}trap

For the \spad{i}\spad{-}th level,{} this is an appropriate combination of all the previous trapezodial estimates so that the error term starts with the \spad{2*(i+1)} power only. \par The three families come in a closed version,{} where the formulas include the endpoints,{} an open version where the formulas do not include the endpoints and an adaptive version,{} where the user is required to input the number of subintervals over which the appropriate closed famil

If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{
973794`--} ...,{} \spad{y},{} \spad{y'},{} \spad{y''},{} ... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential pol
973794`--ynomial domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}.
973794`-- For example,{} one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomial
973794`--s. For differential polynomial domains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

974520`An extensible aggregate is one which allows insertion and deletion of entries. These aggregates are models of lists and streams which are represented by linked structures so as to make insertion,{} deletion,{} and concatenation efficient. However,{} access to elements of these extensible aggregates is generally slow since access is made from the end. See \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for an exception.

974992`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}. If {\em F} is finite then any finite algebraic extension of {\em F} is finite,{} too. Let {\em K} be a finite algebraic extension of the finite field {\em F}. The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The

974992`--spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{g}). Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} monomial(1,{} \spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a,{} \spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}.

977529`This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations. A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make ``evaluation\spad{''} substitutions.

977691`\spadtype{JetBundleBaseFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) of the base space of a jet bundle,{} \spadignore{i.e.} functions depending only on the independent variables. Such a category is needed \spadignore{e.g.} for the representation of solutions.
977808`\spadtype{JetBundleCategory} provides basic data structures and procedures for jet bundles. Nearly all necessary functions are implemented already here. Only the representation and functions which direct access to it must be implemented in a domain. Two notations of derivatives are supported.

978321`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings,{} lists,{} and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate.

981875`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polyno
981875`--mial ring \spad{k[x1,{} ...,{} xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the sa

A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{
981875`--T}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} is a split of Lazard of 
981875`--\spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline

982434`\spadtype{SetCategory} is the basic category for describing a collection of elements with \spadop{=} (equality) and \spadfun{coerce} to output form. \blankline Conditional Attributes: \indented{3}{canonical\tab{15}data structure equality is the same as \spadop{=}}
982491`PointCategory is the category of points and vectors in space. Points may be used to represent shapes in a scenegraph such as: the vertices of a cube or points along a line. Shapes such as these may be defined explicitly or may be plotted. We implement SetCategory to allow us to curry transforms from one point to another.
982554`\spadtype{SquareMatrixCategory} is a general square matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and colums returned as objects of type Col.
982773`A stream aggregate is a linear aggregate which possibly has an infinite number of elements. A basic domain constructor which builds stream aggregates is \spadtype{Stream}. From streams,{} a number of infinite structures such as power series can be built.
982849`A string aggregate is a category for strings,{} that is,{} one dimensional arrays of characters.
982913`A table aggregate is a model of a table,{} \spadignore{i.e.} a discrete many-to-one mapping from keys to entries.
983287`Category of tensor powers of modules over commutative rings.
983422`Category for the transcendental elementary functions.
983518`The category of triangular sets of multivariate polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain. Let \spad{R} be an integral domain and \spad{V} a finite ordered set of variables,{} say \spad{X1 < X2 < ... < Xn}. A set \spad{S} of polynomials in \spad{R[X1,{} X2,{} ...,{} Xn]} is triangular if no elements of \spad{
983518`--S} lies in \spad{R},{} and if two distinct elements of \spad{S} have distinct main variables. Note that the empty set is a triangular set. A triangular set is not necessarily a (lexicographical) Groebner basis and the notion of reduction related to triangular sets is based on the recursive view of polynomials. We recall this notion here and refer to [1] for more details. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a non-constant polynomial \spad{Q} if the degree of \spad{P} in 
983518`--the main variable of \spad{Q} is less than the main degree of \spad{Q}. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a triangular set \spad{T} if it is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. every polynomial of \spad{T}. \newline
983706`Category for the trigonometric functions.
983800`\indented{1}{TwoDimensionalArrayCategory is a general array category which} allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and columns returned as objects of type Col. The index of the 'first' row may be obtained by calling the function 'minRowInde
983800`--x'. The index of the 'first' column may be obtained by calling the function 'minColIndex'. The index of the first element of a 'Row' is the same as the index of the first column in an array and vice versa.
983976`A unary-recursive aggregate is a one where nodes may have either 0 or 1 children. This aggregate models,{} though not precisely,{} a linked list possibly with a single cycle. A node with one children models a non-empty list,{} with the \spadfun{value} of the list designating the head,{} or \spadfun{first},{} of the list,{} and the child designating the tail,{} or \spadfun{rest},{} of the list. A node with no chil
983976`--d then designates the empty list. Since these aggregates are recursive aggregates,{} they may be cyclic.
984068`A constructive unique factorization domain,{} \spadignore{i.e.} where we can constructively factor members into a product of a finite number of irreducible elements.
984150`\spadtype{UnivariateLaurentSeriesCategory} is the category of Laurent series in one variable.
984268`This is a category of univariate Laurent series constructed from univariate Taylor series. A Laurent series is represented by a pair \spad{[n,{} f(x)]},{} where \spad{n} is an arbitrary integer and \spad{f(x)} is a Taylor series. This pair represents the Laurent series \spad{x^n * f(x)}.
984458`The category of univariate polynomials over a ring \spad{R}. No particular model is assumed - implementations can be either sparse or dense.
984561`\spadtype{UnivariatePowerSeriesCategory} is the most general univariate power series category with exponents in an ordered abelian monoid. Note: this category exports a substitution function if it is possible to multiply exponents. Note: this category exports a derivative operation if it is possible to multiply coefficients by exponents.
984714`This is a category of univariate Puiseux series constructed from univariate Laurent series. A Puiseux series is represented by a pair \spad{[r,{} f(x)]},{} where \spad{r} is a positive rational number and \spad{f(x)} is a Laurent series. This pair represents the Puiseux series \spad{f(x^r)}.

This category is an evolution of the types \indented{2}{MonogenicLinearOperator,{} OppositeMonogenicLinearOperator,{} and} \indented{2}{NonCommutativeOperatorDivision} developped by Jean Della Dora and Stephen \spad{M}. Watt.
985017`\spadtype{UnivariateTaylorSeriesCategory} is the category of Taylor series in one variable.
985133`\spadtype{VectorCategory} represents the type of vector like objects,{} \spadignore{i.e.} finite sequences indexed by some finite segment of the integers. The operations available on vectors depend on the structure of the underlying components. Many operations from the component domain are defined for vectors componentwise. It can by assumed that extraction or updating components can be done in constant time.
