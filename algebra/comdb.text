2527`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates.

Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivati
2527`--ves is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline

2721`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{}...,{}\spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{}\spad{x'},{}\spad{x''},{}...,{} \spad{y},{}\spad{y'},{}\spad{
2721`--y''},{}... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential polynomials 
2721`--are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define one deriva
2721`--tive to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial domains,{}
2721`-- this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

12188`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polynomial ring \spad{k[x1,{}...,{}xn]} where
12188`-- \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{}...,{}tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{}...,{}\spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated ideals of the \spad{[T1,{}...,{}\spad{T
12188`--i}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular tria
12188`--ngular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T
12188`--}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition.

Conversely,{} when the array becomes less th

32895`\axiomType{JetBundleExpression} defines expressions over a jet bundle based on \axiomType{Expression Integer}. It allows all kind of algebraic operations. \axiom{simplify} is implemented using Groebner bases in polynomials over kernels. Thus it might not work correctly for general expressions.

33726`\axiomType{JetLazyFunction} takes as argument a domain in \axiomType{JetBundleFunctionCategory} and returns another domain in the same category. This domain has basically the same properties as the argument domain,{} but there is a lazy evaluation mechanism for derivatives. This means that differentiations are not immedately performed. Instead a pointer is established t

Special care is taken for leading derivatives and jet variables to avoid as much as possible the need to evaluate expressions. This entails that the result of \axiom{jetVariables} may contain spurious variables. Furthermore many functions in \axiomType{JetLazyFunction} destructively change their arguments. This affects,{} however,{} only their internal representation,{
33726`--} not the value obtained after full evaluation.

35641`This is used with graph theory code (FiniteGraph,{} DirectedGraph. FunctionGraph,{} and so on) to represent a loop as either a sequence of vertex or arrow indexes depending on context.

The ranking on the differential indeterminate is orderly. This is analogous to the domain \spadtype{Polynomial}. \blankline
39648`\spadtype{OrderlyDifferentialVariable} adds a commonly used orderly ranking to the set of derivatives of an ordered list of differential indeterminates. An orderly ranking is a ranking \spadfun{<} of the derivatives with the property that for two derivatives \spad{u} and \spad{v},{} \spad{u} \spadfun{<} \spad{v} if the \spadfun{order} of \spad{u} is less than that of \spad{v}. This domain belongs to \spadtyp
39648`--e{DifferentialVariableCategory}. It defines \spadfun{weight} to be just \spadfun{order},{} and it defines an orderly ranking \spadfun{<} on derivatives \spad{u} via the lexicographic order on the pair (\spadfun{order}(\spad{u}),{} \spadfun{variable}(\spad{u})).
39744`This constructor produces an ordinary differential ring from a partial differential ring by specifying a variable.
39893`This domain represents truncated weighted polynomials over the "Polynomial" type. The variables must be specified,{} as must the weights. The representation is sparse in the sense that only non-zero terms are represented.

40898`The domain \spadtype{PartialFraction} implements partial fractions over a euclidean domain \spad{R}. This requirement on the argument domain allows us to normalize the fractions. Of particular interest are the 2 forms for these fractions. The ``compact\spad{''} form has only one fractional term per prime in the denominator,{} while the \spad{``p}-adic\spad{''} form expands each numerator \spad{p}-adically via the prime \spad{p} in t
40898`--he denominator. For computational efficiency,{} the compact form is used,{} though the \spad{p}-adic form may be gotten by calling the function \spadfunFrom{padicFraction}{PartialFraction}. For a general euclidean domain,{} it is not known how to factor the denominator. Thus the function \spadfunFrom{partialFraction}{PartialFraction} takes as its second argument an element of \spadtype{Factored(R)}.

941446`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition,{} it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are e
941446`--xtended from the set of derivatives of differential indeterminates to the set of differential polynomials. Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{ev
941446`--al}. A convenient way of referencing derivatives is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline

941707`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{}...,{}\spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{}\spad{x'},{}\spad{x''},{}...

This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial 
941707`--domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For exa
941707`--mple,{} one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For d
941707`--ifferential polynomial domains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

945561`\axiomType{JetBundleBaseFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) of the base space of a jet bundle,{} \spadignore{i.e.} functions depending only on the independent variables. Such a category is needed \spadignore{e.g.} for the representation of solutions.
945678`\axiomType{JetBundleCategory} provides basic data structures and procedures for jet bundles. Nearly all necessary functions are implemented already here. Only the representation and functions which direct access to it must be implemented in a domain. Two notations of derivatives are supported. Default is multi-index notation,{} where the \spad{i}-th entry of the index denotes the number of differentiations taken with respect to \axiom{x^i
945678`--}. In repeated index notation each entry \axiom{\spad{i}} in the index denotes a differentiation with respect to \axiom{x^i}. The choice affects,{} however,{} only in- and output. Internally,{} multi-index notation is used throughout.
945744`\axiomType{JetBundleFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) over a jet bundle. The formal derivative is defined already here. It uses the Jacobi matrix of the functions. The columns of the matrices are enumerated by jet variables. Thus they are represented as a \axiomType{Record} of the matrix and a list of the jet variables. Several simplification routines are impl

946198`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings,{} lists,{} and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example,{} \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument,{} whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most

949705`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polyno
949705`--mial ring \spad{k[x1,{}...,{}xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{}...,{}tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{}...,{}\spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated 
949705`--ideals of the \spad{[T1,{}...,{}\spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family
949705`-- \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it i
949705`--s also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition.
