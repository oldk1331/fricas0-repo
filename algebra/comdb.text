42`The class of additive (commutative) monoids, \spadignore{i.e.} semigroups with an additive identity element. \blankline
87`Abelian monoid ring elements (not necessarily of finite support) of this ring are of the form formal SUM (r_i * e_i) where the r_i are coefficients and the e_i, elements of the ordered abelian monoid, are thought of as exponents or monomials. The monomials commute with each other, but in general do not commute with the coefficients (which themselves may or may not be commutative). See \spadtype{FiniteAbelianMonoidRing} for the case of finite support. A useful common model for polynomials and power series. Conceptually at least, only the non-zero terms are ever operated on.

332`The notion of aggregate serves to model any data structure aggregate, designating any collection of objects, with heterogeneous or homogeneous members, with a finite or infinite number of members, explicitly or implicitly represented. An aggregate can in principle represent everything from a string of characters to abstract sets such as "the set of \spad{x} satisfying relation {\em r(x)}". An attribute \spadtype{finiteAggregate} is used to assert that a domain has a finite number of elements.

2795`A dictionary is an aggregate in which entries can be inserted, searched for and removed. Duplicates are thrown away on insertion. This category models the usual notion of dictionary which involves large amounts of data where copying is impractical. Principal operations are thus destructive (non-copying) ones.

2901`Differential extensions of a ring \spad{R}. Given a differentiation on \spad{R}, extend it to a differentiation on \%.
2961`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition, it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differential indeterminates to the set of differential polynomials. Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader}, \spadfun{initial}, \spadfun{separant}, \spadfun{differentialVariables}, and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore, if the ground ring is a differential ring, then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivatives is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor, one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R}, an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates, a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates, and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline
3106`An ordinary differential ring, that is, a ring with an operation \spadfun{differentiate}. \blankline
3156`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x}, ..., \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates, and the prime notation is used for differentiation, then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x}, \spad{x'}, \spad{x''}, ..., \spad{y}, \spad{y'}, \spad{y''}, ... (Note: in the interpreter, the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates, totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives, and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates, just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example, one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order}, then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates, Very often, a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial domains, this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight}, which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example, one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials, providing a graded ring structure.

3607`An eltable over domains \spad{D} and \spad{I} is a structure which can be viewed as a function from \spad{D} to \spad{I}. Examples of eltable structures range from data structures, \spadignore{e.g.} those of type \spadtype{List}, to algebraic structures, \spadignore{e.g.} \spadtype{Polynomial}.
3660`An eltable aggregate is one which can be viewed as a function. For example, the list \spad{[1, 7, 4]} can be applied to 1, 2, and 3 respectively and will return the integers 1, 7, and 4; thus this list may be viewed as mapping 1 to 1, 2 to 7 and 3 to 4. In general, an aggregate can map members of a domain {\em Dom} to an image domain {\em Im}.

3984`An extensible aggregate is one which allows insertion and deletion of entries. These aggregates are models of lists which are represented by linked structures so as to make insertion, deletion, and concatenation efficient. However, access to elements of these extensible aggregates is generally slow since access is made from the end. See \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for an exception.

4500`The class of all aggregates with a finite number of elements.
4549`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}. If {\em F} is finite then any finite algebraic extension of {\em F} is finite, too. Let {\em K} be a finite algebraic extension of the finite field {\em F}. The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The additive group of {\em K} becomes a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K}, \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F}, \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K}, {\em c, d} from {\em F} and {\em f, g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, \spad{g}). Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, monomial(1, \spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a, \spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}. The operations order and discreteLog associated with the multiplicative exponentiation have additive analogues associated to the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}. These are the functions \spadfun{linearAssociatedOrder} and \spadfun{linearAssociatedLog}, respectively.
4617`This category describes finite rational divisors on a curve, that is finite formal sums SUM(\spad{n} * \spad{P}) where the \spad{n}\spad{'s} are integers and the \spad{P}\spad{'s} are finite rational points on the curve.

5261`A finite-set aggregate models the notion of a finite set, that is, a collection of elements characterized by membership, but not by order or multiplicity. See \spadtype{Set} for an example.
5325`This category is intended as a model for floating point systems. A floating point system is a model for the real numbers. In fact, it is an approximation in the sense that not all real numbers are exactly representable by floating point numbers. A floating point system is characterized by the following: \blankline \indented{2}{1: \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} of the \spadfunFrom{exponent}{FloatingPointSystem}.} \indented{9}{(actual implementations are usually binary or decimal)} \indented{2}{2: \spadfunFrom{precision}{FloatingPointSystem} of the \spadfunFrom{mantissa}{FloatingPointSystem} (arbitrary or fixed)} \indented{2}{3: rounding error for operations} \blankline Because a Float is an approximation to the real numbers, even though it is defined to be a join of a Field and OrderedRing, some of the attributes do not hold. In particular associative(\spad{"+"}) does not hold. Algorithms defined over a field need special considerations when the field is a floating point system.

6058`The category of free Lie algebras. It is used by domains of non-commutative algebra: \spadtype{LiePolynomial} and \spadtype{XPBWPolynomial}.
6140`A domain of this category implements formal linear combinations of elements from a domain \spad{Basis} with coefficients in a domain \spad{R}. The domain \spad{Basis} needs only to belong to the category \spadtype{SetCategory} and \spad{R} to the category \spadtype{Ring}. Thus the coefficient ring may be non-commutative. See the \spadtype{XDistributedPolynomial} constructor for examples of domains built with the \spadtype{FreeModuleCategory} category constructor. Author: Michel Petitot (petitot@lifl.\spad{fr}) \blankline Note (Franz Lehner, June 2009): \spad{FreeModule} originally was not of FreeModuleCategory. Some functions (like \spad{support}, \spad{coefficients}, \spad{monomials}, ...) from here could be moved to \spad{IndexedDirectProductCategory} but at the moment there is no need for this.
6224`This category provides a selection of evaluation operations depending on what the argument type \spad{R} provides.
6289`\spad{S} is \spadtype{FullyLinearlyExplicitOver R} means that \spad{S} is a \spadtype{LinearlyExplicitOver R} and, in addition, if \spad{R} is a \spadtype{LinearlyExplicitOver Integer}, then so is \spad{S}

6417`A is fully retractable to \spad{B} means that A is retractable to \spad{B}, and, in addition, if \spad{B} is retractable to the integers or rational numbers then so is A. In particular, what we are asserting is that there are no integers (rationals) in A which don\spad{'t} retract into \spad{B}.

6778`This category describes domains where \spadfun{\spad{gcd}} can be computed but where there is no guarantee of the existence of \spadfun{factor} operation for factorization into irreducibles. However, if such a \spadfun{factor} operation exist, factorization will be unique up to order and units.
6820`GradedAlgebra(\spad{R}, \spad{E}) denotes ``E-graded \spad{R}-algebra\spad{''}. A graded algebra is a graded module together with a degree preserving \spad{R}-linear map, called the {\em product}. \blankline The name ``product\spad{''} is written out in full so inner and outer products with the same mapping type can be distinguished by name.
6899`GradedModule(\spad{R}, \spad{E}) denotes ``E-graded \spad{R}-module\spad{''}, \spadignore{i.e.} collection of \spad{R}-modules indexed by an abelian monoid \spad{E}. An element \spad{g} of \spad{G[s]} for some specific \spad{s} in \spad{E} is said to be an element of \spad{G} with {\em degree} \spad{s}. Sums are defined in each module \spad{G[s]} so two elements of \spad{G} have a sum if they have the same degree. \blankline Morphisms can be defined and composed by degree to give the mathematical category of graded modules.

7014`All domains for which we can compute hash function compatible with equality.
7056`A homogeneous aggregate is an aggregate of elements all of the same type. In the current system, all aggregates are homogeneous. Two attributes characterize classes of aggregates. Aggregates from domains with attribute \spadtype{finiteAggregate} have a finite number of members. Of course, such a domain may have an infinite number of elements, like, for example \spadtype{List}. Those domains with attribute \spadtype{shallowlyMutable} allow an element to be modified or updated without changing its overall value.

7323`This category represents the direct product of some set with respect to an ordered indexing set. The ordered set \spad{S} is considered as the ``basis elements\spad{''} and the elements from \spad{A} as ``coefficients\spad{''}.
7410`This category represents the product of some set with respect to an indexing set. The set \spad{S} is considered as the ``basis elements\spad{''} and the elements from \spad{A} as ``coefficients\spad{''}. Elements may have infinite support. For \spad{Comparable} (ordered) \spad{S} we assume that support of each element is well-orderd.
7490`This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations. A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make ``evaluation\spad{''} substitutions. The difference between this and \spadtype{Evalable} is that the operations in this category specify the substitution as a pair of arguments rather than as an equation.

7735`\spadtype{JetBundleBaseFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) of the base space of a jet bundle, \spadignore{i.e.} functions depending only on the independent variables. Such a category is needed \spadignore{e.g.} for the representation of solutions.
7817`\spadtype{JetBundleCategory} provides basic data structures and procedures for jet bundles. Nearly all necessary functions are implemented already here. Only the representation and functions which directly access it must be implemented in a domain. Two notations of derivatives are supported. Default is multi-index notation, where the \spad{i}-th entry of the index denotes the number of differentiations taken with respect to \spad{x^i}. In repeated index notation each entry \spad{i} in the index denotes a differentiation with respect to \spad{x^i}. The choice affects, however, only in- and output. Internally, multi-index notation is used throughout.
7864`\spadtype{JetBundleFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) over a jet bundle. The formal derivative is defined already here. It uses the Jacobi matrix of the functions. The columns of the matrices are enumerated by jet variables. Thus they are represented as a \spadtype{Record} of the matrix and a list of the jet variables. Several simplification routines are implemented already here.

8154`The class of all domains which have have lazy representation.
8203`LazyStreamAggregate is the category of streams with lazy evaluation. It is understood that the function 'empty?' will cause lazy evaluation if necessary to determine if there are entries. Functions which call 'empty?', \spadignore{e.g.} 'first' and 'rest', will also cause lazy evaluation if necessary. Elements of LazyStreamAggregate are computed only when strictly needed. Lazy computation means that potential errors are delayed, so errors are detected later than in case of normal (eager) evaluation used by other aggregates.

8470`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings, lists, and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example, \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument, whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most of the operations exported here apply to infinite objects (\spadignore{e.g.} streams) as well to finite ones. If the aggregate is a finite aggregate then it has several additional exports such as \spadfun{reverse}, \spadfun{sort}, and so on.

A polynomial \spad{p} is said normalized with respect to a non-constant polynomial \spad{q} if \spad{p} is constant or \spad{degree(p, mdeg(q)) = 0} and \spad{init(p)} is normalized with respect to \spad{q}.

10747`One-dimensional-array aggregates serves as models for one-dimensional arrays. Categorically, these aggregates are finite linear aggregates with the \spadtype{shallowlyMutable} property, that is, any component of the array may be changed without affecting the identity of the overall array. Array data structures are typically represented by a fixed area in storage and therefore cannot efficiently grow or shrink on demand as can list structures (see however \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for a data structure which is a cross between a list and an array). Iteration over, and access to, elements of arrays is extremely fast (and often can be optimized to open-code). Insertion and deletion however is generally slow since an entirely new data structure must be created for the result.

Furthermore, for \spad{R} being an integral domain, a set of polynomials may be viewed as a representation of the ideal it generates in the polynomial ring \spad{(R)^(-1) P}, or the set of its zeros (described for instance by the radical of the previous ideal, or a split of the associated affine variety) and so on. So this category provides operations about those different notions.

Recursively, a recursive aggregate is either empty or a {\em node} consisting of a \spadfun{value} from \spad{S} and 0 or more \spadfun{children} which are also nodes. A node with no children is called a \spadfun{leaf} node. A recursive aggregate may be cyclic for which some operations as noted may go into an infinite loop.

13755`The category of regular triangular sets, introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions, all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polynomial ring \spad{k[x1, ..., xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1, ..., tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1, ..., \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated ideals of the \spad{[T1, ..., \spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (with respect to Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits, the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline

16566`The category of triangular sets of multivariate polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain. Let \spad{R} be an integral domain and \spad{V} a finite ordered set of variables, say \spad{X1 < X2 < ... < Xn}. A set \spad{S} of polynomials in \spad{R[X1, X2, ..., Xn]} is triangular if no elements of \spad{S} lies in \spad{R}, and if two distinct elements of \spad{S} have distinct main variables. Note that the empty set is a triangular set. A triangular set is not necessarily a (lexicographical) Groebner basis and the notion of reduction related to triangular sets is based on the recursive view of polynomials. We recall this notion here and refer to [1] for more details. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced with respect to a non-constant polynomial \spad{Q} if the degree of \spad{P} in the main variable of \spad{Q} is less than the main degree of \spad{Q}.

Roughly speaking that means that if \spad{s : S} then when converted to \spadtype{Any}, the new object will include both the original object and its type. This is a way of converting arbitrary objects into a single type without losing any of the original information. Any object can be converted to one of \spadtype{Any}.

19126`AssociatedJordanAlgebra takes an algebra \spad{A} and uses \spadfun{*\$A} to define the new multiplications \spad{a*b := (a *\$A b + b *\$A a)/2} (anticommutator). The usual notation \spad{{a, b}_+} cannot be used due to restrictions in the current language.

Also, if the underlying algebra is of type \spadtype{FiniteRankNonAssociativeAlgebra(R)} (\spadignore{i.e.} a non associative algebra over \spad{R} which is a free \spad{R}-module of finite rank), then the same is \spad{true} for the associated Lie algebra.

Thus many categorical properties can by lifted from the underlying component type. Component extraction operations are provided but no updating operations. Thus new direct product elements can either be created by converting vector elements using the \spadfun{directProduct} function or by taking appropriate linear combinations of basis vectors provided by the \spad{unitVector} operation.

23674`\indented{1}{\spadtype{DoubleFloat} is intended to make accessible} hardware floating point arithmetic in \Language{}, either native double precision, or IEEE. On most machines, there will be hardware support for the arithmetic operations: \spadfunFrom{+}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{*}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{/}{DoubleFloat} and possibly also the \spadfunFrom{sqrt}{DoubleFloat} operation. The operations \spadfunFrom{exp}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{log}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{sin}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{cos}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{atan}{DoubleFloat} are normally coded in software based on minimax polynomial/rational approximations. Some general comments about the accuracy of the operations: the operations \spadfunFrom{+}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{*}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{/}{DoubleFloat} and \spadfunFrom{sqrt}{DoubleFloat} are expected to be fully accurate. The operations \spadfunFrom{exp}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{log}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{sin}{DoubleFloat}, \spadfunFrom{cos}{DoubleFloat} and \spadfunFrom{atan}{DoubleFloat} are not expected to be fully accurate. In particular, \spadfunFrom{sin}{DoubleFloat} and \spadfunFrom{cos}{DoubleFloat} will lose all precision for large arguments. \blankline The \spadtype{Float} domain provides an alternative to the \spad{DoubleFloat} domain. It provides an arbitrary precision model of floating point arithmetic. This means that accuracy problems like those above are eliminated by increasing the working precision where necessary. \spadtype{Float} provides some special functions such as \spadfunFrom{erf}{\spad{DoubleFloatSpecialFunctions2}}, the error function in addition to the elementary functions. The disadvantage of \spadtype{Float} is that it is much more expensive than small floats when the latter can be used.

24479`This package provides elementary functions on any Puiseux series domain over a field which was constructed from a Taylor series domain.

25218`A function which does not return directly to its caller should have Exit as its return type. \blankline Note: It is convenient to have a formal \spad{coerce} into each type from type Exit. This allows, for example, errors to be raised in one half of a type-balanced \spad{if}.
25256`UnivariatePuiseuxSeriesWithExponentialSingularity is a domain used to represent essential singularities of functions. Objects in this domain are quotients of sums, where each term in the sum is a univariate Puiseux series times the exponential of a univariate Puiseux series.
25491`ExponentialOfUnivariatePuiseuxSeries is a domain used to represent essential singularities of functions. An object in this domain is a function of the form \spad{exp(f(x))}, where \spad{f(x)} is a Puiseux series with no terms of non-negative degree. Objects are ordered according to order of singularity, with functions which tend more rapidly to zero or infinity considered to be larger. Thus, if \spad{order(f(x)) < order(g(x))}, \spadignore{i.e.} the first non-zero term of \spad{f(x)} has lower degree than the first non-zero term of \spad{g(x)}, then \spad{exp(f(x)) > exp(g(x))}. If \spad{order(f(x)) = order(g(x))}, then the ordering is essentially random. This domain is used in computing limits involving functions with essential singularities.
25646`Expressions involving symbolic functions.
25718`A domain used in the construction of the exterior algebra on a set \spad{X} over a ring \spad{R}. This domain represents the set of all ordered subsets of the set \spad{X}, assumed to be in correspondence with {1, 2, 3, ...}. The ordered subsets are themselves ordered lexicographically and are in bijective correspondence with an ordered basis of the exterior algebra. In this domain we are dealing strictly with the exponents of basis elements which can only be 0 or 1. \blankline The multiplicative identity element of the exterior algebra corresponds to the empty subset of \spad{X}. A coerce from List Integer to an ordered basis element is provided to allow the convenient input of expressions. Another exported function forgets the ordered structure and simply returns the list corresponding to an ordered subset.
25771`\spadtype{Factored} creates a domain whose objects are kept in factored form as long as possible. Thus certain operations like multiplication and \spad{gcd} are relatively easy to do. Others, like addition require somewhat more work, and unless the argument domain provides a factor function, the result may not be completely factored. Each object consists of a unit and a list of factors, where a factor has a member of \spad{R} (the "base"), and exponent and a flag indicating what is known about the base. A flag may be one of "nil", "sqfr", "irred" or "prime", which respectively mean that nothing is known about the base, it is square-free, it is irreducible, or it is prime. The current restriction to integral domains allows simplification to be performed without worrying about multiplication order.
25841`FakePolynomial is a domain of univariate polynomials with coefficients being fractions of multivariate integer polynomials. Coefficients are kept in unsimplified form. This domain exists to avoid cost of recursive \spad{GCD} calls during polynomial evaluation.

28181`A FlexibleArray is the notion of an array intended to allow for growth at the end only. Hence the following efficient operations \indented{2}{\spad{concat!(a, x)} meaning append item \spad{x} at the end of the array \spad{a}} \indented{2}{\spad{delete!(a, n)} meaning delete the last item from the array \spad{a}} Flexible arrays support the other operations inherited from \spadtype{ExtensibleLinearAggregate}. However, these are not efficient. Flexible arrays combine the \spad{O(1)} access time property of arrays with growing and shrinking at the end in \spad{O(1)} (average) time. This is done by using an ordinary array which may have zero or more empty slots at the end. When the array becomes full it is copied into a new larger (50\% larger) array. Conversely, when the array becomes less than 1/2 full, it is copied into a smaller array. Flexible arrays provide for an efficient implementation of many data structures in particular heaps, stacks and sets.

The implications of this are described below. \blankline The model adopted is that arithmetic operations are rounded to to nearest unit in the last place, that is, accurate to within 2^(-\spadfunFrom{bits}{FloatingPointSystem}). Also, the elementary functions and constants are accurate to one unit in the last place. A float is represented as a record of two integers, the mantissa and the exponent. The \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} of the representation is binary, hence a \spad{Record(m: mantissa, e: exponent)} represents the number \spad{m * 2 ^ e}. Though it is not assumed that the underlying integers are represented with a binary \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem}, the code will be most efficient when this is the the case (this is \spad{true} in most implementations of Lisp). The decision to choose the \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} to be binary has some unfortunate consequences. First, decimal numbers like 0.3 cannot be represented exactly. Second, there is a further loss of accuracy during conversion to decimal for output. To compensate for this, if \spad{d} digits of precision are specified, \spad{1 + ceiling(log2(10^d))} bits are used. Two numbers that are displayed identically may therefore be not equal. On the other hand, a significant efficiency loss would be incurred if we chose to use a decimal \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} when the underlying integer base is binary. \blankline Algorithms used: For the elementary functions, the general approach is to apply identities so that the taylor series can be used, and, so that it will converge within \spad{O( sqrt n )} steps. For example, using the identity \spad{exp(x) = exp(x/2)^2}, we can compute \spad{exp(1/3)} to \spad{n} digits of precision as follows. We have \spad{exp(1/3) = exp(2 ^ (-sqrt s) / 3) ^ (2 ^ sqrt s)}. The taylor series will converge in less than sqrt \spad{n} steps and the exponentiation requires sqrt \spad{n} multiplications for a total of \spad{2 sqrt n} multiplications. Assuming integer multiplication costs \spad{O( n^2 )} the overall running time is \spad{O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}. This approach is the best known approach for precisions up to about 10, 000 digits at which point the methods of Brent which are \spad{O( log(n) n^2 )} become competitive. Note also that summing the terms of the taylor series for the elementary functions is done using integer operations. This avoids the overhead of floating point operations and results in efficient code at low precisions. This implementation makes no attempt to reuse storage, relying on the underlying system to do \spadgloss{garbage collection}. \spad{I} estimate that the efficiency of this package at low precisions could be improved by a factor of 2 if in-place operations were available. \blankline Running times: in the following, \spad{n} is the number of bits of precision \indented{5}{\spad{*}, \spad{/}, \spad{sqrt}, \spad{\spad{pi}}, \spad{exp1}, \spad{log2}, \spad{log10}: \spad{ O( n^2 )}} \indented{5}{\spad{exp}, \spad{log}, \spad{sin}, \spad{atan}:\space{2}\spad{ O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}} The other elementary functions are coded in terms of the ones above.

34676`A FlexibleArray is the notion of an array intended to allow for growth at the end only. Hence the following efficient operations \indented{2}{\spad{concat!(a, x)} meaning append item \spad{x} at the end of the array \spad{a}} \indented{2}{\spad{delete!(a, n)} meaning delete the last item from the array \spad{a}} Flexible arrays support the other operations inherited from \spadtype{ExtensibleLinearAggregate}. However, these are not efficient. Flexible arrays combine the \spad{O(1)} access time property of arrays with growing and shrinking at the end in \spad{O(1)} (average) time. This is done by using an ordinary array which may have zero or more empty slots at the end. When the array becomes full it is copied into a new larger (50\% larger) array. Conversely, when the array becomes less than 1/2 full, it is copied into a smaller array. Flexible arrays provide for an efficient implementation of many data structures in particular heaps, stacks and sets.

37160`\spadtype{JetBundleExpression} defines expressions over a jet bundle based on \spadtype{Expression Integer}. It allows all kind of algebraic operations. \spad{simplify} is implemented using Groebner bases in polynomials over kernels. Thus it might not work correctly for general expressions.

37891`\spadtype{JetDifferentialEquation} provides the basic data structures and procedures for differential equations as needed in the geometric theory. Differential equation means here always a submanifold in the jet bundle. The concrete equations which define this submanifold are called system. In an object of the type \spadtype{JetDifferentialEquation} much more than only the system is stored. \spad{D} denotes the class of functions allowed as equations. It is assumed that the \spad{simplify} procedure of \spad{D} returns only independent equations and a system with symbol in row echelon form.
37998`\spadtype{JetLazyFunction} takes as argument a domain in \spadtype{JetBundleFunctionCategory} and returns another domain in the same category. This domain has basically the same properties as the argument domain, but there is a lazy evaluation mechanism for derivatives. This means that differentiations are not immediately performed. Instead a pointer is established to the function to be differentiated. Only when the exact value of the derivative is needed, the differentiation is executed. Special care is taken for leading derivatives and jet variables to avoid as much as possible the need to evaluate expressions. This entails that the result of \spad{jetVariables} may contain spurious variables. Furthermore many functions in \spadtype{JetLazyFunction} destructively change their arguments. This affects, however, only their internal representation, not the value obtained after full evaluation.

40315`This is used with graph theory code (FiniteGraph, DirectedGraph. FunctionGraph, and so on) to represent a loop as either a sequence of vertex or arrow indexes depending on context.

40364`Lyndon words over arbitrary (ordered) symbols: see Free Lie Algebras by \spad{C}. Reutenauer (Oxford science publications). A Lyndon word is a word which is smaller than any of its right factors with respect to the pure lexicographical ordering. If \spad{a} and \spad{b} are two Lyndon words such that \spad{a < b} holds with respect to lexicographical ordering then \spad{a*b} is a Lyndon word. Parenthesized Lyndon words can be generated from symbols by using the following rule: \spad{[[a, b], c]} is a Lyndon word iff \spad{a*b < c <= b} holds. Lyndon words are internally represented by binary trees using the \spadtype{FreeMagma} domain constructor. Two ordering are provided: lexicographic and length-lexicographic.

43081`\spadtype{MonoidRing}(\spad{R}, \spad{M}), implements the algebra of all maps from the monoid \spad{M} to the commutative ring \spad{R} with finite support. Multiplication of two maps \spad{f} and \spad{g} is defined to map an element \spad{c} of \spad{M} to the (convolution) sum over {\em f(a)g(b)} such that {\em ab = c}. Thus \spad{M} can be identified with a canonical basis and the maps can also be considered as formal linear combinations of the elements in \spad{M}. Scalar multiples of a basis element are called monomials. A prominent example is the class of polynomials where the monoid is a direct product of the natural numbers with pointwise addition. When \spad{M} is \spadtype{FreeMonoid Symbol}, one gets polynomials in infinitely many non-commuting variables. Another application area is representation theory of finite groups \spad{G}, where modules over \spadtype{MonoidRing}(\spad{R}, \spad{G}) are studied.

This domain belongs to \spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory}. It defines \spadfun{weight} to be just \spadfun{order}, and it defines an orderly ranking \spadfun{<} on derivatives \spad{u} via the lexicographic order on the pair (\spadfun{order}(\spad{u}), \spadfun{variable}(\spad{u})).

46585`The domain \spadtype{PartialFraction} implements partial fractions over a euclidean domain \spad{R}. This requirement on the argument domain allows us to normalize the fractions. Of particular interest are the 2 forms for these fractions. The ``compact\spad{''} form has only one fractional term per prime in the denominator, while the \spad{``p}-adic\spad{''} form expands each numerator \spad{p}-adically via the prime \spad{p} in the denominator. For computational efficiency, the compact form is used, though the \spad{p}-adic form may be gotten by calling the function \spadfunFrom{padicFraction}{PartialFraction}. For a general euclidean domain, it is not known how to factor the denominator. Thus the function \spadfunFrom{partialFraction}{PartialFraction} takes an element of \spadtype{Factored(R)} as its second argument.

48600`This domain provides modest support for quadratic forms.
48688`\spadtype{QuasiAlgebraicSet} constructs a domain representing quasi-algebraic sets, which is the intersection of a Zariski closed set, defined as the common zeros of a given list of polynomials (the defining polynomials for equations), and a principal Zariski open set, defined as the complement of the common zeros of a polynomial \spad{f} (the defining polynomial for the inequation). This domain provides simplification of a user-given representation using groebner basis computations. There are two simplification routines: the first function \spadfun{idealSimplify} uses groebner basis of ideals alone, while the second, \spadfun{simplify} uses both groebner basis and factorization. The resulting defining equations \spad{L} always form a groebner basis, and the resulting defining inequation \spad{f} is always reduced. The function \spadfun{simplify} may be applied several times if desired. A third simplification routine \spadfun{radicalSimplify} is provided in \spadtype{QuasiAlgebraicSet2} for comparison study only, as it is inefficient compared to the other two, as well as is restricted to only certain coefficient domains. For detail analysis and a comparison of the three methods, please consult the reference cited. \blankline A polynomial function \spad{q} defined on the quasi-algebraic set is equivalent to its reduced form with respect to \spad{L}. While this may be obtained using the usual normal form algorithm, there is no canonical form for \spad{q}. \blankline The ordering in groebner basis computation is determined by the data type of the input polynomials. If it is possible we suggest to use refinements of total degree orderings.

This type is a suitable third argument for \spadtype{GeneralDistributedMultivariatePolynomial}.
55071`This domain exports a modest implementation for the vertices of splitting trees. These vertices are called here splitting nodes. Every of these nodes store 3 informations. The first one is its value, that is the current expression to evaluate. The second one is its condition, that is the hypothesis under which the value has to be evaluated. The last one is its status, that is a boolean flag which is \spad{true} iff the value is the result of its evaluation under its condition. Two splitting vertices are equal iff they have the sane values and the same conditions (so their status do not matter).
55182`This domain exports a modest implementation of splitting trees. Splitting trees are needed when the evaluation of some quantity under some hypothesis requires to split the hypothesis into sub-cases. For instance by adding some new hypothesis on one hand and its negation on another hand. The computations are terminated for a splitting tree \spad{a} when \spad{status(value(a))} is \spad{true}. Thus, if for the splitting tree \spad{a} the flag \spad{status(value(a))} is \spad{true}, then \spad{status(value(d))} is \spad{true} for any subtree \spad{d} of \spad{a}. This property of splitting trees is called the termination condition. If no vertex in a splitting tree \spad{a} is equal to another, \spad{a} is said to satisfy the no-duplicates condition. The splitting tree \spad{a} will satisfy this condition if nodes are added to \spad{a} by means of \spad{splitNodeOf!} and if \spad{construct} is only used to create the root of \spad{a} with no children.

124036`\spad{areEquivalent?(aG0, aG1, randomelements, numberOfTries)} tests whether the two lists of matrices, all assumed of same square shape, can be simultaneously conjugated by a non-singular matrix. If these matrices represent the same group generators, the representations are equivalent. The algorithm tries {\em numberOfTries} times to create elements in the generated algebras in the same fashion. If their ranks differ, they are not equivalent. If an isomorphism is assumed, then the kernel of an element of the first algebra is mapped to the kernel of the corresponding element in the second algebra. Now consider the one-dimensional ones. If they generate the whole space (\spadignore{e.g.} irreducibility !) we use {\em standardBasisOfCyclicSubmodule} to create the only possible transition matrix. The method checks whether the matrix conjugates all corresponding matrices from {\em aGi}. The way to choose the singular matrices is as in {\em meatAxe}. If the two representations are equivalent, this routine returns the transformation matrix {\em TM} with {\em aG0.i * TM = TM * aG1.i} for all \spad{i}. If the representations are not equivalent, a small 0-matrix is returned. Note: the case with different sets of group generators cannot be handled.

The algorithm used is Rabin\spad{'s} probabilistic primality test (reference: Knuth Volume 2 Semi Numerical Algorithms). If \spad{prime? n} returns \spad{false}, \spad{n} is proven composite. If \spad{prime? n} returns \spad{true}, prime? may be in error however, the probability of error is very low. and is zero below 25*10^9 (due to a result of Pomerance et al), below 10^12 and 10^13 due to results of Pinch, and below 341550071728321 due to a result of Jaeschke.

1008192`\spadtype{ComplexRootFindingPackage} provides functions to find all roots of a polynomial \spad{p} over the complex number by using Plesken\spad{'s} idea to calculate in the polynomial ring modulo \spad{f} and employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this first version, the precision (see \spadfunFrom{digits}{Float}) is not increased when this is necessary to avoid rounding errors. Hence it is the user\spad{'s} responsibility to increase the precision if necessary. Note also, if this package is called with \spadignore{e.g.} \spadtype{Fraction Integer}, the precise calculations could require a lot of time. Also note that evaluating the zeros is not necessarily a good check whether the result is correct: already evaluation can cause rounding errors.

Also the names of bound variables and other such constructions may be lost in Lambda \spad{->} Ski \spad{->} Lambda round trip. An element of ILogic cannot be coerced to the other types. However ILogic can be used to produce a theory which can be concerted to/from the other domains using Curry-Howard isomorphism.

1012611`ErrorFunctions implements error functions callable from the system interpreter. Typically, these functions would be called in user functions. The simple forms of the functions take one argument which is either a string (an error message) or a list of strings which all together make up a message. The list can contain formatting codes (see below). The more sophisticated versions takes two arguments where the first argument is the name of the function from which the error was invoked and the second argument is either a string or a list of strings, as above. When you use the one argument version in an interpreter function, the system will automatically insert the name of the function as the new first argument. Thus in the user interpreter function \indented{2}{\spad{f x == if x < 0 then error "negative argument" else x}} the call to error will actually be of the form \indented{2}{\spad{error("f","negative argument")}} because the interpreter will have created a new first argument. \blankline Formatting codes: error messages may contain the following formatting codes (they should either start or end a string or else have blanks around them): \indented{3}{\spad{\%l}\space{6}start a new line} \indented{3}{\spad{\%b}\space{6}start printing in a bold font (where available)} \indented{3}{\spad{\%d}\space{6}stop\space{2}printing in a bold font (where available)} \indented{3}{\spad{ \%ceon}\space{2}start centering message lines} \indented{3}{\spad{\%ceoff}\space{2}stop\space{2}centering message lines} \indented{3}{\spad{\%rjon}\space{3}start displaying lines "ragged left"} \indented{3}{\spad{\%rjoff}\space{2}stop\space{2}displaying lines "ragged left"} \indented{3}{\spad{\%i}\space{6}indent\space{3}following lines 3 additional spaces} \indented{3}{\spad{\%u}\space{6}unindent following lines 3 additional spaces} \indented{3}{\spad{\%xN}\space{5}insert \spad{N} blanks (eg, \spad{\%x10} inserts 10 blanks)} \blankline

1023442`\spadtype{GroebnerPackage} computes groebner bases for polynomial ideals. The basic computation provides a distinguished set of generators for polynomial ideals over fields. This basis allows an easy test for membership: the operation \spadfun{normalForm} returns zero on ideal members. When the provided coefficient domain, Dom, is not a field, the result is equivalent to considering the extended ideal with \spadtype{Fraction(Dom)} as coefficients, but considerably more efficient since all calculations are performed in Dom. Additional argument "info" and "redcrit" can be given to provide incremental information during computation. Argument "info" produces a computational summary for each \spad{s}-polynomial. Argument "redcrit" prints out the reduced critical pairs. The term ordering is determined by the polynomial type used. Suggested types include \spadtype{DistributedMultivariatePolynomial}, \spadtype{HomogeneousDistributedMultivariatePolynomial}, \spadtype{GeneralDistributedMultivariatePolynomial}.

These routines generally have as arguments: \spad{n}, the number of dependent variables; \spad{x1}, the initial point; \spad{h}, the step size; \spad{y}, a vector of initial conditions of length \spad{n} which upon exit contains the solution at \spad{x1 + h}; \spad{derivs}, a function which computes the right hand side of the ordinary differential equation: \spad{derivs(dydx, y, x)} computes \spad{dydx}, a vector which contains the derivative information. \blankline \par In order of increasing complexity: \begin{items} \blankline \item \spad{rk4(y, n, x1, h, derivs)} advances the solution vector to \spad{x1 + h} and return the values in \spad{y}. \blankline \item \spad{rk4(y, n, x1, h, derivs, t1, t2, t3, t4)} is the same as \spad{rk4(y, n, x1, h, derivs)} except that you must provide 4 scratch arrays \spad{t1}-\spad{t4} of size \spad{n}. \blankline \item Starting with \spad{y} at \spad{x1}, \spad{rk4f(y, n, x1, x2, ns, derivs)} uses \spad{ns} fixed steps of a 4-th order Runge-Kutta integrator to advance the solution vector to \spad{x2} and return the values in \spad{y}. Argument \spad{x2}, is the final point, and \spad{ns}, the number of steps to take. \blankline \item \spad{rk4qc(y, n, x1, step, eps, yscal, derivs)} takes a 5-th order Runge-Kutta step with monitoring of local truncation to ensure accuracy and adjust stepsize. The function takes two half steps and one full step and scales the difference in solutions at the final point. If the error is within \spad{eps}, the step is taken and the result is returned. If the error is not within \spad{eps}, the stepsize if decreased and the procedure is tried again until the desired accuracy is reached. Upon input, an trial step size must be given and upon return, an estimate of the next step size to use is returned as well as the step size which produced the desired accuracy. The scaled error is computed as \centerline{\spad{error = MAX(ABS((y2steps(i) - y1step(i))/yscal(i)))}} and this is compared against \spad{eps}. If this is greater than \spad{eps}, the step size is reduced accordingly to \centerline{\spad{hnew = 0.9 * hdid * (error/eps)^(-1/4)}} If the error criterion is satisfied, then we check if the step size was too fine and return a more efficient one. If \spad{error} > \spad{eps} * (6.0E-04) then the next step size should be \centerline{\spad{hnext} = 0.9 * hdid * (\spad{error}/\spad{eps})^(\spad{-1/5})} Otherwise \spad{hnext = 4.0 * hdid} is returned. A more detailed discussion of this and related topics can be found in the book "Numerical Recipes" by \spad{W}.Press, \spad{B}.\spad{P}. Flannery, \spad{S}.A. Teukolsky, \spad{W}.\spad{T}. Vetterling published by Cambridge University Press. Argument \spad{step} is a record of 3 floating point numbers \spad{(to_try , did , next)}, \spad{eps} is the required accuracy, \spad{yscal} is the scaling vector for the difference in solutions. On input, \spad{step.to_try} should be the guess at a step size to achieve the accuracy. On output, \spad{step.did} contains the step size which achieved the accuracy and \spad{step.next} is the next step size to use. \blankline \item \spad{rk4qc(y, n, x1, step, eps, yscal, derivs, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7)} is the same as \spad{rk4qc(y, n, x1, step, eps, yscal, derivs)} except that the user must provide the 7 scratch arrays \spad{t1-t7} of size \spad{n}. \blankline \item \spad{rk4a(y, n, x1, x2, eps, h, ns, derivs)} is a driver program which uses \spad{rk4qc} to integrate \spad{n} ordinary differential equations starting at \spad{x1} to \spad{x2}, keeping the local truncation error to within \spad{eps} by changing the local step size. The scaling vector is defined as \centerline{\spad{yscal(i) = abs(y(i)) + abs(h*dydx(i)) + tiny}} where \spad{y(i)} is the solution at location \spad{x}, \spad{dydx} is the ordinary differential equation\spad{'s} right hand side, \spad{h} is the current step size and \spad{tiny} is 10 times the smallest positive number representable. The user must supply an estimate for a trial step size and the maximum number of calls to \spad{rk4qc} to use.

Because the error term of this rule contains only even powers of the step size (for open and closed versions), fast convergence can be obtained if the integrand is sufficiently smooth. \blankline Each routine returns a Record of type TrapAns, which contains\indent{3} \newline value (\spadtype{Float}): \tab{20} estimate of the integral \newline error (\spadtype{Float}): \tab{20} estimate of the error in the computation \newline totalpts (\spadtype{Integer}): \tab{20} total number of function evaluations \newline success (\spadtype{Boolean}): \tab{20} if the integral was computed within the user specified error criterion \indent{0}\indent{0} To produce this estimate, each routine generates an internal sequence of sub-estimates, denoted by {\em S(i)}, depending on the routine, to which the various convergence criteria are applied. The user must supply a relative accuracy, \spad{eps_r}, and an absolute accuracy, \spad{eps_a}. Convergence is obtained when either \centerline{\spad{ABS(S(i) - S(i-1)) < eps_r * ABS(S(i-1))}} \centerline{or \spad{ABS(S(i) - S(i-1)) < eps_a}} are \spad{true} statements. \blankline The routines come in three families and three flavors: \newline\tab{3} closed: \tab{20}romberg, \tab{30}simpson, \tab{42}trapezoidal \newline\tab{3} open: \tab{20}rombergo, \tab{30}simpsono, \tab{42}trapezoidalo \newline\tab{3} adaptive closed: \tab{20}aromberg, \tab{30}asimpson, \tab{42}atrapezoidal \par The {\em S(i)} for the trapezoidal family is the value of the integral using an equally spaced absicca trapezoidal rule for that level of refinement. \par The {\em S(i)} for the simpson family is the value of the integral using an equally spaced absicca simpson rule for that level of refinement. \par The {\em S(i)} for the romberg family is the estimate of the integral using an equally spaced absicca romberg method. For the \spad{i}\spad{-}th level, this is an appropriate combination of all the previous trapezodial estimates so that the error term starts with the \spad{2*(i+1)} power only. \par The three families come in a closed version, where the formulas include the endpoints, an open version where the formulas do not include the endpoints and an adaptive version, where the user is required to input the number of subintervals over which the appropriate closed family integrator will apply with the usual convergence parameters for each subinterval. This is useful where a large number of points are needed only in a small fraction of the entire domain. \par Each routine takes as arguments: \newline \spad{f}\tab{10} integrand \newline a\tab{10} starting point \newline \spad{b}\tab{10} ending point \newline \spad{eps_r}\tab{10} relative error \newline \spad{eps_a}\tab{10} absolute error \newline \spad{nmin} \tab{10} refinement level when to start checking for convergence (> 1) \newline \spad{nmax} \tab{10} maximum level of refinement \par The adaptive routines take as an additional parameter \newline \spad{nint}\tab{10} the number of independent intervals to apply a closed \indented{1}{family integrator of the same name.} \par Notes: \newline Closed family level \spad{i} uses \spad{1 + 2^i} points. \newline Open family level \spad{i} uses \spad{1 + 3^i} points.

1041466`This package completely solves a parametric linear system of equations by decomposing the set of all parametric values for which the linear system is consistent into a union of quasi-algebraic sets (which need not be irredundant, but most of the time is). Each quasi-algebraic set is described by a list of polynomials that vanish on the set, and a list of polynomials that vanish at no point of the set. For each quasi-algebraic set, the solution of the linear system is given, as a particular solution and a basis of the homogeneous system. The parametric linear system should be given in matrix form, with a coefficient matrix and a right hand side vector. The entries of the coefficient matrix and right hand side vector should be polynomials in the parametric variables, over a Euclidean domain of characteristic zero. \blankline If the system is homogeneous, the right hand side need not be given. The right hand side can also be replaced by an indeterminate vector, in which case, the conditions required for consistency will also be given.

The input is the ordinary polynomial type which is internally converted to a type with the required ordering. The resulting grobner basis is converted back to ordinary polynomials.

1048980`\spadtype{QuasiAlgebraicSet2} adds a function \spadfun{radicalSimplify} which uses \spadtype{IdealDecompositionPackage} to simplify the representation of a quasi-algebraic set. A quasi-algebraic set is the intersection of a Zariski closed set, defined as the common zeros of a given list of polynomials (the defining polynomials for equations), and a principal Zariski open set, defined as the complement of the common zeros of a polynomial \spad{f} (the defining polynomial for the inequation). Quasi-algebraic sets are implemented in the domain \spadtype{QuasiAlgebraicSet}, where two simplification routines are provided: \spadfun{idealSimplify} and \spadfun{simplify}. The function \spadfun{radicalSimplify} is added for comparison study only. Because the domain \spadtype{IdealDecompositionPackage} provides facilities for computing with radical ideals, it is necessary to restrict the ground ring to the domain \spadtype{Fraction Integer}, and the polynomial ring to be of type \spadtype{DistributedMultivariatePolynomial}. The routine \spadfun{radicalSimplify} uses these to compute groebner basis of radical ideals and is inefficient and restricted when compared to the two in \spadtype{QuasiAlgebraicSet}.

1057192`Symbolic solver for systems of rational functions with coefficients in an integral domain \spad{R}. The systems are solved in the field of rational functions over \spad{R}. Solutions are exact of the form variable = value when the value is a member of the coefficient domain \spad{R}. Otherwise the solutions are implicitly expressed as roots of univariate polynomial equations over \spad{R}. Care is taken to guarantee that the denominators of the input equations do not vanish on the solution sets. The arguments to solve can either be given as equations or as rational functions interpreted as equal to zero. The user can specify an explicit list of symbols to be solved for, treating all other symbols appearing as parameters or omit the list of symbols in which case the system tries to solve with respect to all symbols appearing in the input.

1058813`This package tries to find solutions of equations of type Expression(\spad{R}). This means expressions involving transcendental, exponential, logarithmic and nthRoot functions. After trying to transform different kernels to one kernel by applying several rules, it calls zerosOf for the SparseUnivariatePolynomial in the remaining kernel. For example the expression \spad{sin(x)*cos(x)-2} will be transformed to \indented{3}{\spad{-2 tan(x/2)^4 -2 tan(x/2)^3 -4 tan(x/2)^2 +2 tan(x/2) -2}} by using the function normalize and then to \indented{3}{\spad{-2 tan(x)^2 + tan(x) -2}} with help of subsTan. This function tries to express the given function in terms of \spad{tan(x/2)} to express in terms of \spad{tan(x)} . Other examples are the expressions \spad{sqrt(x+1)+sqrt(x+7)+1} or \indented{1}{\spad{sqrt(sin(x))+1} .}

1058964`This package provides functions that compute "fraction-free" inverses of upper and lower triangular matrices over a integral domain.

Note that the mapping is assumed to send zero to zero, since it will only be applied to the non-zero coefficients of the polynomial.
1061127`This package implements Karatsuba\spad{'s} trick for multiplying (large) univariate polynomials. It could be improved with a version doing the work on place and also with a special case for squares. We've done this in Basicmath, but we believe that this out of the scope of FriCAS.
1061241`This package provides for square-free decomposition of univariate polynomials over arbitrary rings, \spadignore{i.e.} a partial factorization such that each factor is a product of irreducibles with multiplicity one and the factors are pairwise relatively prime. If the ring has characteristic zero, the result is guaranteed to satisfy this condition. If the ring is an infinite ring of finite characteristic, then it may not be possible to decide when polynomials contain factors which are \spad{p}th powers. In this case, the flag associated with that polynomial is set to "nil" (meaning that that polynomials are not guaranteed to be square-free).

1063257`A package for computing symbolically the complex and real roots of zero-dimensional algebraic systems over the integer or rational numbers. Complex roots are given by means of univariate representations of irreducible regular chains. Real roots are given by means of tuples of coordinates lying in the \spadtype{RealClosure} of the coefficient ring. This constructor takes three arguments. The first one \spad{R} is the coefficient ring. The second one \spad{ls} is the list of variables involved in the systems to solve. The third one must be \spad{concat(ls, s)} where \spad{s} is an additional symbol used for the univariate representations. WARNING: The third argument is not checked. All operations are based on triangular decompositions. The default is to compute these decompositions directly from the input system by using the \spadtype{RegularChain} domain constructor. The lexTriangular algorithm can also be used for computing these decompositions (see the \spadtype{LexTriangularPackage} package constructor). For that purpose, the operations \spadopFrom{univariateSolve}{ZeroDimensionalSolvePackage}, \spadopFrom{realSolve}{ZeroDimensionalSolvePackage} and \spadopFrom{positiveSolve}{ZeroDimensionalSolvePackage} admit an optional argument. \newline Author: Marc Moreno Maza.

1063501`Abelian monoid ring elements (not necessarily of finite support) of this ring are of the form formal SUM (r_i * e_i) where the r_i are coefficients and the e_i, elements of the ordered abelian monoid, are thought of as exponents or monomials. The monomials commute with each other, but in general do not commute with the coefficients (which themselves may or may not be commutative). See \spadtype{FiniteAbelianMonoidRing} for the case of finite support. A useful common model for polynomials and power series. Conceptually at least, only the non-zero terms are ever operated on.

1065009`Differential extensions of a ring \spad{R}. Given a differentiation on \spad{R}, extend it to a differentiation on \%.
1065098`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition, it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differential indeterminates to the set of differential polynomials. Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader}, \spadfun{initial}, \spadfun{separant}, \spadfun{differentialVariables}, and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore, if the ground ring is a differential ring, then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivatives is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor, one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R}, an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates, a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates, and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline
1065291`An ordinary differential ring, that is, a ring with an operation \spadfun{differentiate}. \blankline
1065359`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x}, ..., \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates, and the prime notation is used for differentiation, then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x}, \spad{x'}, \spad{x''}, ..., \spad{y}, \spad{y'}, \spad{y''}, ... (Note: in the interpreter, the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates, totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives, and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates, just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example, one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order}, then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates, Very often, a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial domains, this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight}, which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example, one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials, providing a graded ring structure.

For example, the list \spad{[1, 7, 4]} can be applied to 1, 2, and 3 respectively and will return the integers 1, 7, and 4; thus this list may be viewed as mapping 1 to 1, 2 to 7 and 3 to 4.

1066114`An extensible aggregate is one which allows insertion and deletion of entries. These aggregates are models of lists which are represented by linked structures so as to make insertion, deletion, and concatenation efficient.

1066517`This category is similar to AbelianMonoidRing, except that the sum is assumed to be finite. It is a useful model for polynomials, but is somewhat more general.
1066648`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}. If {\em F} is finite then any finite algebraic extension of {\em F} is finite, too. Let {\em K} be a finite algebraic extension of the finite field {\em F}. The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The additive group of {\em K} becomes a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K}, \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F}, \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K}, {\em c, d} from {\em F} and {\em f, g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, \spad{g}). Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a, monomial(1, \spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a, \spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}. The operations order and discreteLog associated with the multiplicative exponentiation have additive analogues associated to the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}. These are the functions \spadfun{linearAssociatedOrder} and \spadfun{linearAssociatedLog}, respectively.

The domain \spad{Basis} needs only to belong to the category \spadtype{SetCategory} and \spad{R} to the category \spadtype{Ring}. Thus the coefficient ring may be non-commutative. See the \spadtype{XDistributedPolynomial} constructor for examples of domains built with the \spadtype{FreeModuleCategory} category constructor. Author: Michel Petitot (petitot@lifl.\spad{fr}) \blankline Note (Franz Lehner, June 2009): \spad{FreeModule} originally was not of FreeModuleCategory. Some functions (like \spad{support}, \spad{coefficients}, \spad{monomials}, ...) from here could be moved to \spad{IndexedDirectProductCategory} but at the moment there is no need for this.
1068099`This category provides a selection of evaluation operations depending on what the argument type \spad{R} provides.
1068188`\spad{S} is \spadtype{FullyLinearlyExplicitOver R} means that \spad{S} is a \spadtype{LinearlyExplicitOver R} and, in addition, if \spad{R} is a \spadtype{LinearlyExplicitOver Integer}, then so is \spad{S}
1068286`A is fully retractable to \spad{B} means that A is retractable to \spad{B}, and, in addition, if \spad{B} is retractable to the integers or rational numbers then so is A. In particular, what we are asserting is that there are no integers (rationals) in A which don\spad{'t} retract into \spad{B}.
1068370`This category is a model for the function field of a plane algebraic curve.
1068578`A space of formal functions with arguments in an arbitrary ordered set.
1068681`This category describes domains where \spadfun{\spad{gcd}} can be computed but where there is no guarantee of the existence of \spadfun{factor} operation for factorization into irreducibles. However, if such a \spadfun{factor} operation exist, factorization will be unique up to order and units.
1068734`GradedAlgebra(\spad{R}, \spad{E}) denotes ``E-graded \spad{R}-algebra\spad{''}. A graded algebra is a graded module together with a degree preserving \spad{R}-linear map, called the {\em product}. \blankline The name ``product\spad{''} is written out in full so inner and outer products with the same mapping type can be distinguished by name.
1068837`GradedModule(\spad{R}, \spad{E}) denotes ``E-graded \spad{R}-module\spad{''}, \spadignore{i.e.} collection of \spad{R}-modules indexed by an abelian monoid \spad{E}. An element \spad{g} of \spad{G[s]} for some specific \spad{s} in \spad{E} is said to be an element of \spad{G} with {\em degree} \spad{s}. Sums are defined in each module \spad{G[s]} so two elements of \spad{G} have a sum if they have the same degree. \blankline Morphisms can be defined and composed by degree to give the mathematical category of graded modules.
1068936`The class of multiplicative groups, \spadignore{i.e.} monoids with multiplicative inverses. \blankline
1068980`All domains for which we can compute hash function compatible with equality.
1069032`A homogeneous aggregate is an aggregate of elements all of the same type. In the current system, all aggregates are homogeneous. Two attributes characterize classes of aggregates. Aggregates from domains with attribute \spadtype{finiteAggregate} have a finite number of members. Of course, such a domain may have an infinite number of elements, like, for example \spadtype{List}. Those domains with attribute \spadtype{shallowlyMutable} allow an element to be modified or updated without changing its overall value.
1069118`Category for the hyperbolic trigonometric functions.
1069205`An indexed aggregate is a many-to-one mapping of indices to entries. For example, a one-dimensional-array is an indexed aggregate where the index is an integer. Also, a table is an indexed aggregate where the indices and entries may have any type.
1069318`This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations. A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make ``evaluation\spad{''} substitutions. The difference between this and \spadtype{Evalable} is that the operations in this category specify the substitution as a pair of arguments rather than as an equation.
1069410`An \spad{IntegerNumberSystem} is a model for the integers.
1069480`\spadtype{JetBundleBaseFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) of the base space of a jet bundle, \spadignore{i.e.} functions depending only on the independent variables. Such a category is needed \spadignore{e.g.} for the representation of solutions.
1069597`\spadtype{JetBundleCategory} provides basic data structures and procedures for jet bundles. Nearly all necessary functions are implemented already here. Only the representation and functions which directly access it must be implemented in a domain. Two notations of derivatives are supported. Default is multi-index notation, where the \spad{i}-th entry of the index denotes the number of differentiations taken with respect to \spad{x^i}. In repeated index notation each entry \spad{i} in the index denotes a differentiation with respect to \spad{x^i}. The choice affects, however, only in- and output. Internally, multi-index notation is used throughout.
1069663`\spadtype{JetBundleFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) over a jet bundle. The formal derivative is defined already here. It uses the Jacobi matrix of the functions. The columns of the matrices are enumerated by jet variables. Thus they are represented as a \spadtype{Record} of the matrix and a list of the jet variables. Several simplification routines are implemented already here.
1069774`A keyed dictionary is a dictionary of key-entry pairs for which there is a unique entry for each key.
1069879`LazyStreamAggregate is the category of streams with lazy evaluation. It is understood that the function 'empty?' will cause lazy evaluation if necessary to determine if there are entries. Functions which call 'empty?', \spadignore{e.g.} 'first' and 'rest', will also cause lazy evaluation if necessary. Elements of LazyStreamAggregate are computed only when strictly needed. Lazy computation means that potential errors are delayed, so errors are detected later than in case of normal (eager) evaluation used by other aggregates. In some cases computation that would signal error when using eager evaluation can succeed when using lazy evaluation.
1069965`The category of all left algebras over an arbitrary ring.
1070032`The category of Lie Algebras. It is used by the following domains of non-commutative algebra: \spadtype{LiePolynomial} and \spadtype{XPBWPolynomial}.
1070110`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings, lists, and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example, \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument, whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most of the operations exported here apply to infinite objects (\spadignore{e.g.} streams) as well to finite ones. If the aggregate is a finite aggregate then it has several additional exports such as \spadfun{reverse}, \spadfun{sort}, and so on.
1070186`\spad{LinearOrdinaryDifferentialOperatorCategory} is the category of differential operators with coefficients in a ring A with a given derivation. Multiplication of operators corresponds to functional composition: \indented{4}{\spad{(L1 * L2).(f) = L1 L2 f}}
1070316`A list aggregate is a model for a linked list data structure. A linked list is a versatile data structure. Insertion and deletion are efficient and searching is a linear operation.

1070538`\spadtype{MatrixCategory} is a general matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and columns returned as objects of type Col. A domain belonging to this category will be shallowly mutable. The index of the 'first' row may be obtained by calling the function \spadfun{minRowIndex}. The index of the 'first' column may be obtained by calling the function \spadfun{minColIndex}. The index of the first element of a Row is the same as the index of the first column in a matrix and vice versa.
1070696`The category for general multi-variate possibly skew polynomials over a ring \spad{R}, in variables from VarSet, with exponents from the \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup}.

1071531`OctonionCategory gives the categorial frame for the octonions, and eight-dimensional non-associative algebra, doubling the quaternions in the same way as doubling the Complex numbers to get the quaternions.
1071617`One-dimensional-array aggregates serves as models for one-dimensional arrays. Categorically, these aggregates are finite linear aggregates with the \spadtype{shallowlyMutable} property, that is, any component of the array may be changed without affecting the identity of the overall array. Array data structures are typically represented by a fixed area in storage and therefore cannot efficiently grow or shrink on demand as can list structures (see however \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for a data structure which is a cross between a list and an array). Iteration over, and access to, elements of arrays is extremely fast (and often can be optimized to open-code). Insertion and deletion however is generally slow since an entirely new data structure must be created for the result.
1071719`\spadtype{OpenMath} provides operations for exporting an object in OpenMath format.
1071766`Ordered sets which are also abelian groups, such that the addition preserves the ordering.
1071840`The class of totally ordered sets, that is, sets such that for each pair of elements \spad{(a, b)} exactly one of the following relations holds \spad{a<b or a=b or b<a} and the relation is transitive, \spadignore{i.e.} \spad{a<b and b<c => a<c}. This order should be the natural order on given structure.

1072213`This is the category of domains that know "enough" about themselves in order to factor univariate polynomials over their fraction field.
1072310`A category for finite subsets of a polynomial ring. Such a set is only regarded as a set of polynomials and not identified to the ideal it generates. So two distinct sets may generate the same the ideal. Furthermore, for \spad{R} being an integral domain, a set of polynomials may be viewed as a representation of the ideal it generates in the polynomial ring \spad{(R)^(-1) P}, or the set of its zeros (described for instance by the radical of the previous ideal, or a split of the associated affine variety) and so on. So this category provides operations about those different notions.
1072508`holds a complete set together with a structure to codify the partial order. for more documentation see: \url{http://www.euclideanspace.com/prog/scratchpad/mycode/discrete/logic/index.\spad{htm}}

1073050`The real number system category is intended as a model for the real numbers. The real numbers form an ordered normed field. Note that we have purposely not included \spadtype{DifferentialRing} or the elementary functions (see \spadtype{TranscendentalFunctionCategory}) in the definition.
1073114`\spadtype{RealRootCharacterizationCategory} provides common access functions for all real root codings.
1073324`\spadtype{RectangularMatrixCategory} is a category of matrices of fixed dimensions. The dimensions of the matrix will be parameters of the domain. Domains in this category will be \spad{R}-modules and will be non-mutable.
1073563`A recursive aggregate over a type \spad{S} is a model for a a directed graph containing values of type \spad{S}. Recursively, a recursive aggregate is either empty or a {\em node} consisting of a \spadfun{value} from \spad{S} and 0 or more \spadfun{children} which are also nodes. A node with no children is called a \spadfun{leaf} node. A recursive aggregate may be cyclic for which some operations as noted may go into an infinite loop.
1073645`A category for general multi-variate polynomials with coefficients in a ring, variables in an ordered set, and exponents from an ordered abelian monoid, with a \spadfun{sup} operation. When not constant, such a polynomial is viewed as a univariate polynomial in its main variable \spad{w}. \spad{r}. \spad{t}. to the total ordering on the elements in the ordered set, so that some operations usually defined for univariate polynomials make sense here.
1073794`The category of regular triangular sets, introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions, all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polynomial ring \spad{k[x1, ..., xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1, ..., tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1, ..., \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated ideals of the \spad{[T1, ..., \spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (with respect to Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1, ..., Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits, the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline

1074181`A set category lists a collection of set-theoretic operations useful for both finite sets and multisets. Note however that finite sets are distinct from multisets. Although the operations defined for set categories are common to both, the relationship between the two cannot be described by inclusion or inheritance.
1074259`\spadtype{SetCategory} is the basic category for describing a collection of elements with \spadop{=} (equality) and \spadfun{coerce} to output form. \blankline Conditional Attributes: \indented{3}{canonical\tab{15}data structure equality is the same as \spadop{=}}
1074316`PointCategory is the category of points and vectors in space. Points may be used to represent shapes in a scenegraph such as: the vertices of a cube or points along a line. Shapes such as these may be defined explicitly or may be plotted. We implement SetCategory to allow us to curry transforms from one point to another.
1074379`\spadtype{SquareMatrixCategory} is a general square matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and columns returned as objects of type Col.
1074598`A stream aggregate is a linear aggregate which possibly has an infinite number of elements. A basic domain constructor which builds stream aggregates is \spadtype{Stream}. From streams, a number of infinite structures such as power series can be built.
1074674`A string aggregate is a category for strings, that is, one dimensional arrays of characters.

1075118`Category of tensor powers of modules over commutative rings.
1075253`Category for the transcendental elementary functions.
1075349`The category of triangular sets of multivariate polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain. Let \spad{R} be an integral domain and \spad{V} a finite ordered set of variables, say \spad{X1 < X2 < ... < Xn}. A set \spad{S} of polynomials in \spad{R[X1, X2, ..., Xn]} is triangular if no elements of \spad{S} lies in \spad{R}, and if two distinct elements of \spad{S} have distinct main variables. Note that the empty set is a triangular set. A triangular set is not necessarily a (lexicographical) Groebner basis and the notion of reduction related to triangular sets is based on the recursive view of polynomials. We recall this notion here and refer to [1] for more details. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced with respect to a non-constant polynomial \spad{Q} if the degree of \spad{P} in the main variable of \spad{Q} is less than the main degree of \spad{Q}. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced with respect to a triangular set \spad{T} if it is reduced with respect to every polynomial of \spad{T}. \newline

1075631`\indented{1}{TwoDimensionalArrayCategory is a general array category which} allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and columns returned as objects of type Col. The index of the 'first' row may be obtained by calling the function 'minRowIndex'. The index of the 'first' column may be obtained by calling the function 'minColIndex'. The index of the first element of a 'Row' is the same as the index of the first column in an array and vice versa.
1075813`A unary-recursive aggregate is an aggregate where nodes may have either 0 or 1 children. This aggregate models, though not precisely, a linked list possibly with a single cycle. A node with one children models a non-empty list, with the \spadfun{value} of the list designating the head, or \spadfun{first}, of the list, and the child designating the tail, or \spadfun{rest}, of the list. Since these aggregates are recursive aggregates, they may be cyclic.
1075905`A constructive unique factorization domain, \spadignore{i.e.} where we can constructively factor members into a product of a finite number of irreducible elements.
1075987`\spadtype{UnivariateLaurentSeriesCategory} is the category of Laurent series in one variable.
1076105`This is a category of univariate Laurent series constructed from univariate Taylor series. A Laurent series is represented by a pair \spad{[n, f(x)]}, where \spad{n} is an arbitrary integer and \spad{f(x)} is a Taylor series. This pair represents the Laurent series \spad{x^n * f(x)}.

1076867`\spadtype{UnivariateTaylorSeriesCategory} is the category of Taylor series in one variable.
1076983`\spadtype{VectorCategory} represents the type of vector like objects, \spadignore{i.e.} finite sequences indexed by some finite segment of the integers. The operations available on vectors depend on the structure of the underlying components. Many operations from the component domain are defined for vectors componentwise. It can by assumed that extraction or updating components can be done in constant time.
