2527`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition,{} it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differ

Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivati
2527`--ves is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline
2672`An ordinary differential ring,{} that is,{} a ring with an operation \spadfun{differentiate}. \blankline
2721`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{} ...,{} \spad{y},{} \spad{y'},{}
2721`-- \spad{y''},{} ... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential poly
2721`--nomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define on
2721`--e derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial do
2721`--mains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

3964`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}.

The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The additive group of {\em K} becomes
3964`-- a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K},{} \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K},{} {\em c,{} d} from {\em F} and {\em f,{} g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{}

Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} monomial(1,{} \spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a,{} \spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}.

25648`\spadtype{Float} implements arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic. The number of significant digits of each operation can be set to an arbitrary value (the default is 20 decimal digits). The operation \spad{float(mantissa,{} exponent,{} \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem})} for integer \spad{mantissa},{} \spad{exponent} specifies the number \spad{mantissa * \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} ^ exponent} The underlying represent
25648`--ation for floats is binary not decimal. The implications of this are described below. \blankline The model adopted is that arithmetic operations are rounded to to nearest unit in the last place,{} that is,{} accurate to within \spad{2^(-\spadfunFrom{bits}{FloatingPointSystem})}. Also,{} the elementary functions and constants are accurate to one unit in the last place. A float is represented as a record of two integers,{} the mantissa and the exponent. The \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem
25648`--} of the representation is binary,{} hence a \spad{Record(m: mantissa,{} e: exponent)} represents the number \spad{m * 2 ^ e}. Though it is not assumed that the underlying integers are represented with a binary \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem},{} the code will be most efficient when this is the the case (this is \spad{true} in most implementations of Lisp). The decision to choose the \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} to be binary has some unfortunate consequences. First,{} decimal
25648`-- numbers like 0.3 cannot be represented exactly. Second,{} there is a further loss of accuracy during conversion to decimal for output. To compensate for this,{} if \spad{d} digits of precision are specified,{} \spad{1 + ceiling(log2(10^d))} bits are used. Two numbers that are displayed identically may therefore be not equal. On the other hand,{} a significant efficiency loss would be incurred if we chose to use a decimal \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} when the underlying integer base
25648`-- is binary. \blankline Algorithms used: For the elementary functions,{} the general approach is to apply identities so that the taylor series can be used,{} and,{} so that it will converge within \spad{O( sqrt n )} steps. For example,{} using the identity \spad{exp(x) = exp(x/2)^2},{} we can compute \spad{exp(1/3)} to \spad{n} digits of precision as follows. We have \spad{exp(1/3) = exp(2 ^ (-sqrt s) / 3) ^ (2 ^ sqrt s)}. The taylor series will converge in less than sqrt \spad{n} steps and the
25648`-- exponentiation requires sqrt \spad{n} multiplications for a total of \spad{2 sqrt n} multiplications. Assuming integer multiplication costs \spad{O( n^2 )} the overall running time is \spad{O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}. This approach is the best known approach for precisions up to about 10,{} 000 digits at which point the methods of Brent which are \spad{O( log(n) n^2 )} become competitive. Note also that summing the terms of the taylor series for the elementary functions is done using integer operation

40642`\spadtype{OrderlyDifferentialVariable} adds a commonly used orderly ranking to the set of derivatives of an ordered list of differential indeterminates.

41892`The domain \spadtype{PartialFraction} implements partial fractions over a euclidean domain \spad{R}. This requirement on the argument domain allows us to normalize the fractions. Of particular interest are the 2 forms for these fractions. The ``compact\spad{''} form has only one fractional term per prime in the denominator,{} while the \spad{``p}-adic\spad{''} form expands each numerator \spad{p}-adically via the prime \spad{p} in t
41892`--he denominator. For computational efficiency,{} the compact form is used,{} though the \spad{p}-adic form may be gotten by calling the function \spadfunFrom{padicFraction}{PartialFraction}.

933516`\spadtype{GroebnerPackage} computes groebner bases for polynomial ideals. The basic computation provides a distinguished set of generators for polynomial ideals over fields. This basis allows an easy test for membership: the operation \spadfun{normalForm} returns zero on ideal members. When the provided coefficient domain,{} Dom,{} is not 
933516`--a field,{} the result is equivalent to considering the extended ideal with \spadtype{Fraction(Dom)} as coefficients,{} but considerably more efficient since all calculations are performed in Dom. Additional argument "info" and "redcrit" can be given to provide incremental information during computation. Argument "info" produces a computational summary for each \spad{s}-polynomial. Argument "redcrit" prints out the reduced critical pairs. The term ordering is determined by the polynomial type u

For example,{} the list \spad{[1,{} 7,{} 4]} can applied to 0,{} 1,{} and 2 respectively will return the integers 1,{} 7,{} and 4; thus this list may be viewed as mapping 0 to 1,{} 1 to 7 and 2 to 4. In general,{} an aggregate can map members of a domain {\em Dom} to an image domain {\em Im}.
974219`Entire Rings (non-commutative Integral Domains),{} \spadignore{i.e.} a ring not necessarily commutative which has no zero divisors. \blankline
974275`A constructive euclidean domain,{} \spadignore{i.e.} one can divide producing a quotient and a remainder where the remainder is either zero or is smaller (\spadfun{euclideanSize}) than the divisor. \blankline Conditional attributes: \indented{2}{multiplicativeValuation\tab{25}\spad{Size(a*b)=Size(a)*Size(b)}} \indented{2}{additiveValuation\tab{25}\spad{Size(a*b)=Size(a)+Size(b)}}
974340`This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations. A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make ``evaluation\spad{''} substitutions.
974410`An expression space is a set which is closed under certain operators.
974471`An extensible aggregate is one which allows insertion and deletion of entries. These aggregates are models of lists and streams which are represented by linked structures so as to make insertion,{} deletion,{} and concatenation efficient. However,{} access to elements of these extensible aggregates is generally slow since access is made from the end. See \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for an exception.
974567`ExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which extend the field \spad{F}
974637`The category of commutative fields,{} \spadignore{i.e.} commutative rings where all non-zero elements have multiplicative inverses. The \spadfun{factor} operation while trivial is useful to have defined. \blankline
974681`FieldOfPrimeCharacteristic is the category of fields of prime characteristic,{} \spadignore{e.g.} finite fields,{} algebraic closures of fields of prime characteristic,{} transcendental extensions of of fields of prime characteristic.
974765`The category of domains composed of a finite set of elements. We include the functions \spadfun{lookup} and \spadfun{index} to give a bijection between the finite set and an initial segment of positive integers. \blankline
974812`This category is similar to AbelianMonoidRing,{} except that the sum is assumed to be finite. It is a useful model for polynomials,{} but is somewhat more general.
974943`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}. If {\em F} is finite then any finite algebraic extension of {\em F} is finite,{} too. Let {\em K} be a finite algebraic extension of the finite field {\em F}. The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The
974943`-- additive group of {\em K} becomes a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K},{} \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K},{} {\em c,{} d} from {\em F} and {\em f,{} g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \
974943`--spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{g}). Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} monomial(1,{} \spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a,{} \spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}. The operations order and discreteLog associated with the multiplicative exponentiation have additive analogues associated to the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedE
974943`--xp}. These are the functions \spadfun{linearAssociatedOrder} and \spadfun{linearAssociatedLog},{} respectively.
975047`This category describes finite rational divisors on a curve,{} that is finite formal sums SUM(\spad{n} * \spad{P}) where the \spad{n}\spad{'s} are integers and the \spad{P}\spad{'s} are finite rational points on the curve.
975276`FiniteFieldCategory is the category of finite fields
975350`Category of finite graphs,{} allows us to model graph theory \blankline
975425`The category of finite groups.
975482`A finite linear aggregate is a linear aggregate of finite length. The finite property of the aggregate adds several exports to the list of exports from \spadtype{LinearAggregate} such as \spadfun{reverse},{} \spadfun{sort},{} and so on.
975570`A FiniteRankAlgebra is an algebra over a commutative ring \spad{R} which is a free \spad{R}-module of finite rank.
975704`A FiniteRankNonAssociativeAlgebra is a non associative algebra over a commutative ring \spad{R} which is a free \spad{R}-module of finite rank.
975825`A finite-set aggregate models the notion of a finite set,{} that is,{} a collection of elements characterized by membership,{} but not by order or multiplicity. See \spadtype{Set} for an example.
975914`This category is intended as a model for floating point systems. A floating point system is a model for the real numbers. In fact,{} it is an approximation in the sense that not all real numbers are exactly representable by floating point numbers. A floating point system is characterized by the following: \blankline \indented{2}{1: \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} of the \spadfunFrom{exponent}{FloatingPointSystem}.} \indented{9

In particular associative(\spad{"+"}) does not hold. Algorithms defined over a field 
975914`--need special considerations when the field is a floating point system.
975984`A \spadtype{FramedAlgebra} is a \spadtype{FiniteRankAlgebra} together with a fixed \spad{R}-module basis.
976110`FramedNonAssociativeAlgebra(\spad{R}) is a \spadtype{FiniteRankNonAssociativeAlgebra} (\spadignore{i.e.} a non associative algebra over \spad{R} which is a free \spad{R}-module of finite rank) over a commutative ring \spad{R} together with a fixed \spad{R}-module basis.
976223`A domain of this category implements formal linear combinations of elements from a domain \spad{Basis} with coefficients in a domain \spad{R}. The domain \spad{Basis} needs only to belong to the category \spadtype{SetCategory} and \spad{R} to the category \spadtype{Ring}. Thus the coefficient ring may be non-commutative.

976612`This category is a model for the function field of a plane algebraic curve.
976820`A space of formal functions with arguments in an arbitrary ordered set.
976895`This category describes domains where \spadfun{\spad{gcd}} can be computed but where there is no guarantee of the existence of \spadfun{factor} operation for factorisation into irreducibles. However,{} if such a \spadfun{factor} operation exist,{} factorization will be unique up to order and units.
976948`GradedAlgebra(\spad{R},{} \spad{E}) denotes ``E-graded \spad{R}-algebra\spad{''}. A graded algebra is a graded module together with a degree preserving \spad{R}-linear map,{} called the {\em product}. \blankline The name ``product\spad{''} is written out in full so inner and outer products with the same mapping type can be distinguished by name.
977051`GradedModule(\spad{R},{} \spad{E}) denotes ``E-graded \spad{R}-module\spad{''},{} \spadignore{i.e.} collection of \spad{R}-modules indexed by an abelian monoid \spad{E}. An element \spad{g} of \spad{G[s]} for some specific \spad{s} in \spad{E} is said to be an element of \spad{G} with {\em degree} \spad{s}. Sums are defined in each module \spad{G[s]} so two elements of \spad{G} have a sum if they have the 
977051`--same degree. \blankline Morphisms can be defined and composed by degree to give the mathematical category of graded modules.
977150`The class of multiplicative groups,{} \spadignore{i.e.} monoids with multiplicative inverses. \blankline
977194`A homogeneous aggregate is an aggregate of elements all of the same type. In the current system,{} all aggregates are homogeneous. Two attributes characterize classes of aggregates. Aggregates from domains with attribute \spadatt{finiteAggregate} have a finite number of members. Of course,{} such a domain may have an infinite number of elements,{} like,{} for example \spadtype{List}. Those domains with attribute \spada
977194`--tt{shallowlyMutable} allow an element to be modified or updated without changing its overall value.
977280`Category for the hyperbolic trigonometric functions.
977367`An indexed aggregate is a many-to-one mapping of indices to entries. For example,{} a one-dimensional-array is an indexed aggregate where the index is an integer. Also,{} a table is an indexed aggregate where the indices and entries may have any type.
977487`This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations. A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make ``evaluation\spad{''} substitutions. The difference between this and \spadtype{Evalable} is that the operations in this category specify the substitution as a pair of arguments rather than as an equation.
977579`An \spad{IntegerNumberSystem} is a model for the integers.
977649`\spadtype{JetBundleBaseFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) of the base space of a jet bundle,{} \spadignore{i.e.} functions depending only on the independent variables. Such a category is needed \spadignore{e.g.} for the representation of solutions.
977766`\spadtype{JetBundleCategory} provides basic data structures and procedures for jet bundles. Nearly all necessary functions are implemented already here. Only the representation and functions which direct access to it must be implemented in a domain. Two notations of derivatives are supported. Default is multi-index notation,{} where the \spad{i}-th entry of the index denotes the number of differentiations taken with respect to \spad{x^i}.
977766`-- In repeated index notation each entry \spad{i} in the index denotes a differentiation with respect to \spad{x^i}. The choice affects,{} however,{} only in- and output. Internally,{} multi-index notation is used throughout.
977832`\spadtype{JetBundleFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) over a jet bundle. The formal derivative is defined already here. It uses the Jacobi matrix of the functions. The columns of the matrices are enumerated by jet variables. Thus they are represented as a \spadtype{Record} of the matrix and a list of the jet variables. Several simplification routines are implem
977832`--ented already here.
977943`A keyed dictionary is a dictionary of key-entry pairs for which there is a unique entry for each key.
978055`LazyStreamAggregate is the category of streams with lazy evaluation. It is understood that the function 'empty?' will cause lazy evaluation if necessary to determine if there are entries. Functions which call 'empty?',{} \spadignore{e.g.} 'first' and 'rest',{} will also cause lazy evaluation if necessary.
978141`The category of all left algebras over an arbitrary ring.
978208`The category of Lie Algebras. It is used by the following domains of non-commutative algebra: \spadtype{LiePolynomial} and \spadtype{XPBWPolynomial}. \newline Author : Michel Petitot (petitot@lifl.\spad{fr}).
978286`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings,{} lists,{} and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example,{} \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument,{} whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most 
978286`--of the operations exported here apply to infinite objects (\spadignore{e.g.} streams) as well to finite ones. For finite linear aggregates,{} see \spadtype{FiniteLinearAggregate}.
978362`\spad{LinearOrdinaryDifferentialOperatorCategory} is the category of differential operators with coefficients in a ring A with a given derivation. Multiplication of operators corresponds to functional composition: \indented{4}{\spad{(L1 * L2).(f) = L1 L2 f}}
978492`A list aggregate is a model for a linked list data structure. A linked list is a versatile data structure. Insertion and deletion are efficient and searching is a linear operation.
978564``Logic' provides the basic operations for lattices,{} \spadignore{e.g.} boolean algebra.
978608`\spadtype{MatrixCategory} is a general matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and colums returned as objects of type Col. A domain belonging to this category will be shallowly mutable. The index of the 'first' row may be obtained by
978608`-- calling the function \spadfun{minRowIndex}. The index of the 'first' column may be obtained by calling the function \spadfun{minColIndex}. The index of the first element of a Row is the same as the index of the first column in a matrix and vice versa.

979755`One-dimensional-array aggregates serves as models for one-dimensional arrays. Categorically,{} these aggregates are finite linear aggregates with the \spadatt{shallowlyMutable} property,{} that is,{} any component of the array may be changed without affecting the identity of the overall array. Array data structures are typically represented by a fixed area in storage and therefore cannot efficiently gro

Iteration over,{} and access to,{} elements of arrays is extremely fast (and often can be optimized to open-code). Insertion and deletion however is generally slow since an entirely new data structure must be created for the result.

980322`This is the category of domains that know "enough" about themselves in order to factor univariate polynomials over themselves. This will be used in future releases for supporting factorization over finitely generated coefficient fields,{} it is not yet available in the current release of axiom.
980419`A category for finite subsets of a polynomial ring. Such a set is only regarded as a set of polynomials and not identified to the ideal it generates. So two distinct sets may generate the same the ideal. Furthermore,{} for \spad{R} being an integral domain,{} a set of polynomials may be viewed as a representa

980617`\spadtype{PowerSeriesCategory} is the most general power series category with exponents in an ordered abelian monoid.
980772`\spadtype{QuaternionCategory} describes the category of quaternions and implements functions that are not representation specific.

981370`\spadtype{RectangularMatrixCategory} is a category of matrices of fixed dimensions. The dimensions of the matrix will be parameters of the domain. Domains in this category will be \spad{R}-modules and will be non-mutable.
981609`A recursive aggregate over a type \spad{S} is a model for a a directed graph containing values of type \spad{S}. Recursively,{} a recursive aggregate is a {\em node} consisting of a \spadfun{value} from \spad{S} and 0 or more \spadfun{children} which are recursive aggregates. A node with no children is called a \spadfun{leaf} node. A recursive aggregate may be cyclic for which some operations as noted may go into an infini

981691`A category for general multi-variate polynomials with coefficients in a ring,{} variables in an ordered set,{} and exponents from an ordered abelian monoid,{} with a \spadfun{sup} operation.

981840`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polyno
981840`--mial ring \spad{k[x1,{} ...,{} xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the sa
981840`--turated ideals of the \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} \spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{
981840`--T}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} is a split of Lazard of 
981840`--\spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline

982321`A set category lists a collection of set-theoretic operations useful for both finite sets and multisets. Note however that finite sets are distinct from multisets. Although the operations defined for set categories are common to both,{} the relationship between the two cannot be described by inclusion or inheritance.
982399`\spadtype{SetCategory} is the basic category for describing a collection of elements with \spadop{=} (equality) and \spadfun{coerce} to output form. \blankline Conditional Attributes: \indented{3}{canonical\tab{15}data structure equality is the same as \spadop{=}}
982456`PointCategory is the category of points and vectors in space. Points may be used to represent shapes in a scenegraph such as: the vertices of a cube or points along a line. Shapes such as these may be defined explicitly or may be plotted. We implement SetCategory to allow us to curry transforms from one point to another.
982519`\spadtype{SquareMatrixCategory} is a general square matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and colums returned as objects of type Col.
982738`A stream aggregate is a linear aggregate which possibly has an infinite number of elements. A basic domain constructor which builds stream aggregates is \spadtype{Stream}. From streams,{} a number of infinite structures such as power series can be built.

983259`Category of tensor powers of modules over commutative rings.
983394`Category for the transcendental elementary functions.
983490`The category of triangular sets of multivariate polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain. Let \spad{R} be an integral domain and \spad{V} a finite ordered set of variables,{} say \spad{X1 < X2 < ... < Xn}. A set \spad{S} of polynomials in \spad{R[X1,{} X2,{} ...,{} Xn]} is triangular if no elements of \spad{
983490`--S} lies in \spad{R},{} and if two distinct elements of \spad{S} have distinct main variables. Note that the empty set is a triangular set. A triangular set is not necessarily a (lexicographical) Groebner basis and the notion of reduction related to triangular sets is based on the recursive view of polynomials. We recall this notion here and refer to [1] for more details. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a non-constant polynomial \spad{Q} if the degree of \spad{P} in 
983490`--the main variable of \spad{Q} is less than the main degree of \spad{Q}. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a triangular set \spad{T} if it is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. every polynomial of \spad{T}. \newline

983948`A unary-recursive aggregate is a one where nodes may have either 0 or 1 children. This aggregate models,{} though not precisely,{} a linked list possibly with a single cycle. A node with one children models a non-empty list,{} with the \spadfun{value} of the list designating the head,{} or \spadfun{first},{} of the list,{} and the child designating the tail,{} or \spadfun{rest},{} of the list. A node with no chil

984040`A constructive unique factorization domain,{} \spadignore{i.e.} where we can constructively factor members into a product of a finite number of irreducible elements.
984122`\spadtype{UnivariateLaurentSeriesCategory} is the category of Laurent series in one variable.
984240`This is a category of univariate Laurent series constructed from univariate Taylor series. A Laurent series is represented by a pair \spad{[n,{} f(x)]},{} where \spad{n} is an arbitrary integer and \spad{f(x)} is a Taylor series. This pair represents the Laurent series \spad{x^n * f(x)}.
984430`The category of univariate polynomials over a ring \spad{R}. No particular model is assumed - implementations can be either sparse or dense.
984533`\spadtype{UnivariatePowerSeriesCategory} is the most general univariate power series category with exponents in an ordered abelian monoid. Note: this category exports a substitution function if it is possible to multiply exponents. Note: this category exports a derivative operation if it is possible to multiply coefficients by exponents.
984686`This is a category of univariate Puiseux series constructed from univariate Laurent series. A Puiseux series is represented by a pair \spad{[r,{} f(x)]},{} where \spad{r} is a positive rational number and \spad{f(x)} is a Laurent series. This pair represents the Puiseux series \spad{f(x^r)}.
984877`This is the category of univariate skew polynomials over an Ore coefficient ring. The multiplication is given by \spad{x a = \sigma(a) x + \delta a}. This category is an evolution of the types \indented{2}{MonogenicLinearOperator,{} OppositeMonogenicLinearOperator,{} and} \indented{2}{NonCommutativeOperatorDivision} developped by Jean Della Dora and Stephen \spad{M}. Watt.
984989`\spadtype{UnivariateTaylorSeriesCategory} is the category of Taylor series in one variable.
985105`\spadtype{VectorCategory} represents the type of vector like objects,{} \spadignore{i.e.} finite sequences indexed by some finite segment of the integers. The operations available on vectors depend on the structure of the underlying components. Many operations from the component domain are defined for vectors componentwise. It can by assumed that extraction or updating components can be done in constant time.
