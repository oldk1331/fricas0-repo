2548`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates.

Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivati
2548`--ves is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline

2742`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{}...,{}\spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{}\spad{x'},{}\spad{x''},{}...,{} \spad{y},{}\spad{y'},{}\spad{
2742`--y''},{}... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential polynomials 
2742`--are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define one deriva
2742`--tive to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial domains,{}
2742`-- this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

11838`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers).

In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polynomial ring \spad{k[x1,{}...,{}xn]} where
11838`-- \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{}...,{}tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{}...,{}\spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated ideals of the \spad{[T1,{}...,{}\spad{T

A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular tria
11838`--ngular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T
11838`--}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition.

880379`--\spad{h},{} the step size; \spad{y},{} a vector of initial conditions of length \spad{n} which upon exit contains the solution at \spad{x1 + h}; \spad{derivs},{} a function which computes the right hand side of the ordinary differential equation: \spad{derivs(dydx,{}y,{}x)} computes \spad{dydx},{} a vector which contains the derivative information. \blankline \par In order of increasing complexity:\begin{items} \blankline \item \spad{rk4(y,{}n,{}x1,{}h,{}derivs)} advances the solution vector t

880379`--{y}. Argument \spad{x2},{} is the final point,{} and \spad{ns},{} the number of steps to take. \blankline \item \spad{rk4qc(y,{}n,{}x1,{}step,{}eps,{}yscal,{}derivs)} takes a 5-th order Runge-Kutta step with monitoring of local truncation to ensure accuracy and adjust stepsize. The function takes two half steps and one full step and scales the difference in solutions at the final point. If the error is within \spad{eps},{} the step is taken and the result is returned. If the error is not withi
880379`--n \spad{eps},{} the stepsize if decreased and the procedure is tried again until the desired accuracy is reached. Upon input,{} an trial step size must be given and upon return,{} an estimate of the next step size to use is returned as well as the step size which produced the desired accuracy. The scaled error is computed as \center{\spad{error = MAX(ABS((y2steps(i) - y1step(i))/yscal(i)))}} and this is compared against \spad{eps}. If this is greater than \spad{eps},{} the step size is reduced

If \spad{error > \spad{eps} * (6.0E-04)} then the next step size should be \center{\spad{hnext = 0.9 * hdid * (error/\spad{eps})^(\spad{-1/5})}} Otherwise \spad{hnext = 4.0 * hdid} is returned.

Argument \spad{step} is a record of 3 floating point numbers \spad{(to_try ,{} did ,{} next)},{} \spad{eps} is the required accuracy,{} \spad{yscal} is the scaling vector for the difference in solutions. On input,{} \spad{step.to_try} should be the guess at a step size to achieve the accuracy. On output,{} \spad{step.did} contains the step size which achieved the a
880379`--ccuracy and \spad{step.next} is the next step size to use. \blankline \item \spad{rk4qc(y,{}n,{}x1,{}step,{}eps,{}yscal,{}derivs,{}t1,{}t2,{}t3,{}t4,{}t5,{}t6,{}t7)} is the same as \spad{rk4qc(y,{}n,{}x1,{}step,{}eps,{}yscal,{}derivs)} except that the user must provide the 7 scratch arrays \spad{t1-t7} of size \spad{n}. \blankline \item \spad{rk4a(y,{}n,{}x1,{}x2,{}eps,{}h,{}ns,{}derivs)} is a driver program which uses \spad{rk4qc} to integrate \spad{n} ordinary differential equations starting
880379`-- at \spad{x1} to \spad{x2},{} keeping the local truncation error to within \spad{eps} by changing the local step size. The scaling vector is defined as \center{\spad{yscal(i) = abs(y(i)) + abs(h*dydx(i)) + tiny}} where \spad{y(i)} is the solution at location \spad{x},{} \spad{dydx} is the ordinary differential equation\spad{'s} right hand side,{} \spad{h} is the current step size and \spad{tiny} is 10 times the smallest positive number representable.

880447`This suite of routines performs numerical quadrature using algorithms derived from the basic trapezoidal rule. Because the error term of this rule contains only even powers of the step size (for open and closed versions),{} fast convergence can be obtained if the integrand is sufficiently smooth. \blankline Each routine returns a Record of type TrapAns,{} which contains\indent{3} \newline value (\spadtype{Float}):\tab{20} estimate of the integral \newlin

880447`--d. The user must supply a relative accuracy,{} \spad{eps_r},{} and an absolute accuracy,{} \spad{eps_a}. Convergence is obtained when either \center{\spad{ABS(S(i) - S(i-1)) < eps_r * ABS(S(i-1))}} \center{or \spad{ABS(S(i) - S(i-1)) < eps_a}} are \spad{true} statements. \blankline The routines come in three families and three flavors: \newline\tab{3} closed:\tab{20}romberg,{}\tab{30}simpson,{}\tab{42}trapezoidal \newline\tab{3} open: \tab{20}rombergo,{}\tab{30}simpsono,{}\tab{42}trapezoidalo

For the \spad{i}\spad{-}th level,{} this is an appropriate combination of all the previous trapezodial estimates so that the error term starts with the \spad{2*(i+1)} power only. \par The three families come in a closed version,{} where the formulas include the endpoints,{} an open version where the formulas do not include the endpoints and an adaptive version,{} where the user is required to input the number of subintervals over which the appropriate closed family integrator

This is useful where a large number of points are needed only in a small fraction of the entire domain. \par Each routine takes as arguments: \newline \spad{f}\tab{10} integrand \newline a\tab{10} starting point \newline \spad{b}\tab{10} ending point \newline \spad{eps_r}\tab{10} relative error \newline \spad{eps_a}\tab{10} absolute error \newline \spad{nmin} \tab{10} refinement level when to start checking for convergence

If \spad{x},{}...,{}\spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{}\spad{x'},{}\spad{x''},{}...
904672`--,{} \spad{y},{}\spad{y'},{}\spad{y''},{}... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial 
904672`--domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For exa
904672`--mple,{} one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For d
904672`--ifferential polynomial domains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

904959`Category for the elementary functions.
905047`An eltable aggregate is one which can be viewed as a function. For example,{} the list \axiom{[1,{}7,{}4]} can applied to 0,{}1,{} and 2 respectively will return the integers 1,{}7,{} and 4; thus this list may be viewed as mapping 0 to 1,{} 1 to 7 and 2 to 4. In general,{} an aggregate can map members of a domain {\em Dom} to an image domain {\em Im}.

905288`An expression space is a set which is closed under certain operators.
905349`An extensible aggregate is one which allows insertion and deletion of entries. These aggregates are models of lists and streams which are represented by linked structures so as to make insertion,{} deletion,{} and concatenation efficient. However,{} access to elements of these extensible aggregates is generally slow since access is made from the end. See \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for an exception.
905445`ExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which extend the field \spad{F}
905515`The category of commutative fields,{} \spadignore{i.e.} commutative rings where all non-zero elements have multiplicative inverses. The \spadfun{factor} operation while trivial is useful to have defined. \blankline

905643`The category of domains composed of a finite set of elements. We include the functions \spadfun{lookup} and \spadfun{index} to give a bijection between the finite set and an initial segment of positive integers. \blankline
905690`This category is similar to AbelianMonoidRing,{} except that the sum is assumed to be finite. It is a useful model for polynomials,{} but is somewhat more general.
905821`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}. If {\em F} is finite then any finite algebraic extension of {\em F} is finite,{} too. Let {\em K} be a finite algebraic extension of the finite field {\em F}. The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The
905821`-- additive group of {\em K} becomes a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a:K,{}f:SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K},{} {\em c,{}d} from {\em F} and {\em f,{}g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{}cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{}\spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssocia

Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{}monomial(1,{}\spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a,{}\spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}. The operations order and discreteLog associated with the multiplicative exponentiation have additive analogues associated to the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}. These are the functi

906660`This category is intended as a model for floating point systems. A floating point system is a model for the real numbers. In fact,{} it is an approximation in the sense that not all real numbers are exactly representable by floating point numbers.

906969`A domain of this category implements formal linear combinations of elements from a domain \spad{Basis} with coefficients in a domain \spad{R}. The domain \spad{Basis} needs only to belong to the category \spadtype{SetCategory} and \spad{R} to the category \spadtype{Ring}. Thus the coefficient ring may be non-commutative.

907641`This category describes domains where \spadfun{\spad{gcd}} can be computed but where there is no guarantee of the existence of \spadfun{factor} operation for factorisation into irreducibles. However,{} if such a \spadfun{factor} operation exist,{} factorization will be unique up to order and units.
907694`GradedAlgebra(\spad{R},{}\spad{E}) denotes ``E-graded \spad{R}-algebra\spad{''}. A graded algebra is a graded module together with a degree preserving \spad{R}-linear map,{} called the {\em product}. \blankline The name ``product\spad{''} is written out in full so inner and outer products with the same mapping type can be distinguished by name.

An element \spad{g} of \spad{G[s]} for some specific \spad{s} in \spad{E} is said to be an element of \spad{G} with {\em degree} \spad{s}. Sums are defined in each module \spad{G[s]} so two elements of \spad{G} have a sum if they have the s

907940`A homogeneous aggregate is an aggregate of elements all of the same type. In the current system,{} all aggregates are homogeneous. Two attributes characterize classes of aggregates. Aggregates from domains with attribute \spadatt{finiteAggregate} have a finite number of members.

908113`An indexed aggregate is a many-to-one mapping of indices to entries. For example,{} a one-dimensional-array is an indexed aggregate where the index is an integer. Also,{} a table is an indexed aggregate where the indices and entries may have any type.
908233`This category provides \spadfun{eval} operations. A domain may belong to this category if it is possible to make ``evaluation\spad{''} substitutions. The difference between this and \spadtype{Evalable} is that the operations in this category specify the substitution as a pair of arguments rather than as an equation.

908458`\axiomType{JetBundleBaseFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) of the base space of a jet bundle,{} \spadignore{i.e.} functions depending only on the independent variables. Such a category is needed \spadignore{e.g.} for the representation of solutions.
908575`\axiomType{JetBundleCategory} provides basic data structures and procedures for jet bundles. Nearly all necessary functions are implemented already here. Only the representation and functions which direct access to it must be implemented in a domain. Two notations of derivatives are supported. Default is multi-index notation,{} where the \spad{i}-th entry of the index denotes the number of differentiations taken with respect to \axiom{x^i
908575`--}. In repeated index notation each entry \axiom{\spad{i}} in the index denotes a differentiation with respect to \axiom{x^i}. The choice affects,{} however,{} only in- and output. Internally,{} multi-index notation is used throughout.
908641`\axiomType{JetBundleFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) over a jet bundle. The formal derivative is defined already here. It uses the Jacobi matrix of the functions. The columns of the matrices are enumerated by jet variables. Thus they are represented as a \axiomType{Record} of the matrix and a list of the jet variables. Several simplification routines are impl

909102`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings,{} lists,{} and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example,{} \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument,{} whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most

912445`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polyno
912445`--mial ring \spad{k[x1,{}...,{}xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{}...,{}tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{}...,{}\spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated 
912445`--ideals of the \spad{[T1,{}...,{}\spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family
912445`-- \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{}...,{}Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it i
912445`--s also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition.

Although the operations defined for set categories are common to both,{} the relationship between the two cannot be described by inclusion or inheritance.
912966`\spadtype{SetCategory} is the basic category for describing a collection of elements with \spadop{=} (equality) and \spadfun{coerce} to output form. \blankline Conditional Attributes: \indented{3}{canonical\tab{15}data structure equality is the same as \spadop{=}}
913023`PointCategory is the category of points and vectors in space. Points may be used to represent shapes in a scenegraph such as: the vertices of a cube or points along a line. Shapes such as these may be defined explicitly or may be plotted. We implement SetCategory to allow us to curry transforms from one point to another.
913086`\spadtype{SquareMatrixCategory} is a general square matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and colums returned as objects of type Col.

914064`The category of triangular sets of multivariate polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain. Let \axiom{\spad{R}} be an integral domain and \axiom{\spad{V}} a finite ordered set of variables,{} say \axiom{\spad{X1} < \spad{X2} < ... < \spad{Xn}}. A set \axiom{\spad{S}} of polynomials in \axiom{\spad{R}[\spad{X1
914064`--},{}\spad{X2},{}...,{}\spad{Xn}]} is triangular if no elements of \axiom{\spad{S}} lies in \axiom{\spad{R}},{} and if two distinct elements of \axiom{\spad{S}} have distinct main variables. Note that the empty set is a triangular set. A triangular set is not necessarily a (lexicographical) Groebner basis and the notion of reduction related to triangular sets is based on the recursive view of polynomials. We recall this notion here and refer to [1] for more details. A polynomial \axiom{\spad{P}
914064`--} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a non-constant polynomial \axiom{\spad{Q}} if the degree of \axiom{\spad{P}} in the main variable of \axiom{\spad{Q}} is less than the main degree of \axiom{\spad{Q}}. A polynomial \axiom{\spad{P}} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a triangular set \axiom{\spad{T}} if it is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. every polynomial of \axiom{\spad{T}}. \newline References : \indented{1}{[1] \spad{P}.

914522`A unary-recursive aggregate is a one where nodes may have either 0 or 1 children. This aggregate models,{} though not precisely,{} a linked list possibly with a single cycle. A node with one children models a non-empty list,{} with the \spadfun{value} of the list designating the head,{} or \spadfun{first},{} of the list,{} and the child designating the tail,{} or \spadfun{rest},{} of the list. A node with no chil
