2885`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition,{} it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differential indeterminates to the set of differential polynomials. Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivatives is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline
3030`An ordinary differential ring,{} that is,{} a ring with an operation \spadfun{differentiate}. \blankline
3080`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{} ...,{} \spad{y},{} \spad{y'},{} \spad{y''},{} ... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial domains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

3584`An eltable aggregate is one which can be viewed as a function.

4469`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}. If {\em F} is finite then any finite algebraic extension of {\em F} is finite,{} too. Let {\em K} be a finite algebraic extension of the finite field {\em F}. The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The additive group of {\em K} becomes a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K},{} \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K},{} {\em c,{} d} from {\em F} and {\em f,{} g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{g}). Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} monomial(1,{} \spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a,{} \spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}.

8070`The class of all domains which have have lazy representation.
8119`LazyStreamAggregate is the category of streams with lazy evaluation. It is understood that the function 'empty?' will cause lazy evaluation if necessary to determine if there are entries. Functions which call 'empty?',{} \spadignore{e.g.} 'first' and 'rest',{} will also cause lazy evaluation if necessary. Elements of LazyStreamAggregate are computed only when strictly needed. Lazy computation means that potential errors are delayed,{} so errors are detected later than in case of normal (eager) evaluation used by other aggregates. In some cases computation that would signal error when using eager evaluation can succeed when using lazy evaluation.

8386`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings,{} lists,{} and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example,{} \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument,{} whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most of the operations exported here apply to infinite objects (\spadignore{e.g.} streams) as well to finite ones. If the aggregate is a finite aggregate then it has several additional exports such as \spadfun{reverse},{} \spadfun{sort},{} and so on.

13580`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polynomial ring \spad{k[x1,{} ...,{} xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated ideals of the \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} \spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline

27818`A FlexibleArray is the notion of an array intended to allow for growth at the end only. Hence the following efficient operations \indented{2}{\spad{concat!(a,{} x)} meaning append item \spad{x} at the end of the array \spad{a}} \indented{2}{\spad{delete!(a,{} n)} meaning delete the last item from the array \spad{a}} Flexible arrays support the other operations inherited from \spadtype{ExtensibleLinearAggregate}. However,{} these are not efficient. Flexible arrays combine the \spad{O(1)} access time property of arrays with growing and shrinking at the end in \spad{O(1)} (average) time. This is done by using an ordinary array which may have zero or more empty slots at the end. When the array becomes full it is copied into a new larger (50\% larger) array. Conversely,{} when the array becomes less than 1/2 full,{} it is copied into a smaller array. Flexible arrays provide for an efficient implementation of many data structures in particular heaps,{} stacks and sets.
27904`\spadtype{Float} implements arbitrary precision floating point arithmetic. The number of significant digits of each operation can be set to an arbitrary value (the default is 20 decimal digits). The operation \spadfunFrom{float}{FloatingPointSystem}(mantissa,{} exponent,{} \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem}) for integer \spad{mantissa},{} \spad{exponent} specifies the number \spad{mantissa} * \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} ^ \spad{exponent} The underlying representation for floats is binary not decimal. The implications of this are described below. \blankline The model adopted is that arithmetic operations are rounded to to nearest unit in the last place,{} that is,{} accurate to within 2^(-\spadfunFrom{bits}{FloatingPointSystem}). Also,{} the elementary functions and constants are accurate to one unit in the last place. A float is represented as a record of two integers,{} the mantissa and the exponent. The \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} of the representation is binary,{} hence a \spad{Record(m: mantissa,{} e: exponent)} represents the number \spad{m * 2 ^ e}. Though it is not assumed that the underlying integers are represented with a binary \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem},{} the code will be most efficient when this is the the case (this is \spad{true} in most implementations of Lisp). The decision to choose the \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} to be binary has some unfortunate consequences. First,{} decimal numbers like 0.3 cannot be represented exactly. Second,{} there is a further loss of accuracy during conversion to decimal for output. To compensate for this,{} if \spad{d} digits of precision are specified,{} \spad{1 + ceiling(log2(10^d))} bits are used. Two numbers that are displayed identically may therefore be not equal. On the other hand,{} a significant efficiency loss would be incurred if we chose to use a decimal \spadfunFrom{base}{FloatingPointSystem} when the underlying integer base is binary. \blankline Algorithms used: For the elementary functions,{} the general approach is to apply identities so that the taylor series can be used,{} and,{} so that it will converge within \spad{O( sqrt n )} steps. For example,{} using the identity \spad{exp(x) = exp(x/2)^2},{} we can compute \spad{exp(1/3)} to \spad{n} digits of precision as follows. We have \spad{exp(1/3) = exp(2 ^ (-sqrt s) / 3) ^ (2 ^ sqrt s)}. The taylor series will converge in less than sqrt \spad{n} steps and the exponentiation requires sqrt \spad{n} multiplications for a total of \spad{2 sqrt n} multiplications. Assuming integer multiplication costs \spad{O( n^2 )} the overall running time is \spad{O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}. This approach is the best known approach for precisions up to about 10,{} 000 digits at which point the methods of Brent which are \spad{O( log(n) n^2 )} become competitive. Note also that summing the terms of the taylor series for the elementary functions is done using integer operations. This avoids the overhead of floating point operations and results in efficient code at low precisions. This implementation makes no attempt to reuse storage,{} relying on the underlying system to do \spadgloss{garbage collection}. \spad{I} estimate that the efficiency of this package at low precisions could be improved by a factor of 2 if in-place operations were available. \blankline Running times: in the following,{} \spad{n} is the number of bits of precision \indented{5}{\spad{*},{} \spad{/},{} \spad{sqrt},{} \spad{\spad{pi}},{} \spad{exp1},{} \spad{log2},{} \spad{log10}: \spad{ O( n^2 )}} \indented{5}{\spad{exp},{} \spad{log},{} \spad{sin},{} \spad{atan}:\space{2}\spad{ O( sqrt(n) n^2 )}} The other elementary functions are coded in terms of the ones above.

Multiplication of two maps \spad{f} and \spad{g} is defined to map an element \spad{c} of \spad{M} to the (convolution) sum over {\em f(a)g(b)} such that {\em ab = c}.

54666`This domain exports a modest implementation for the vertices of splitting trees. These vertices are called here splitting nodes. Every of these nodes store 3 informations.

54777`This domain exports a modest implementation of splitting trees. Splitting trees are needed when the evaluation of some quantity under some hypothesis requires to split the hypothesis into sub-cases. For instance by adding some new hypothesis on one hand and its negation on another hand. The computations are terminated for a splitting tree \spad{a} when \spad{status(value(a))} is \spad{true}. Thus,{} if for the splitting tree \spad{a} the flag \spad{status(value(a))} is \spad{true},{} then \spad{status(value(d))} is \spad{true} for any subtree \spad{d} of \spad{a}. This property of splitting trees is called the termination condition. If no vertex in a splitting tree \spad{a} is equal to another,{} \spad{a} is said to satisfy the no-duplicates condition. The splitting tree \spad{a} will satisfy this condition if nodes are added to \spad{a} by means of \spad{splitNodeOf!} and if \spad{construct} is only used to create the root of \spad{a} with no children.

These routines generally have as arguments: \spad{n},{} the number of dependent variables; \spad{x1},{} the initial point; \spad{h},{} the step size; \spad{y},{} a vector of initial conditions of length \spad{n} which upon exit contains the solution at \spad{x1 + h}; \spad{derivs},{} a function which computes the right hand side of the ordinary differential equation: \spad{derivs(dydx,{} y,{} x)} computes \spad{dydx},{} a vector which contains the derivative information. \blankline \par In order of increasing complexity: \begin{items} \blankline \item \spad{rk4(y,{} n,{} x1,{} h,{} derivs)} advances the solution vector to \spad{x1 + h} and return the values in \spad{y}. \blankline \item \spad{rk4(y,{} n,{} x1,{} h,{} derivs,{} t1,{} t2,{} t3,{} t4)} is the same as \spad{rk4(y,{} n,{} x1,{} h,{} derivs)} except that you must provide 4 scratch arrays \spad{t1}-\spad{t4} of size \spad{n}. \blankline \item Starting with \spad{y} at \spad{x1},{} \spad{rk4f(y,{} n,{} x1,{} x2,{} ns,{} derivs)} uses \spad{ns} fixed steps of a 4-th order Runge-Kutta integrator to advance the solution vector to \spad{x2} and return the values in \spad{y}. Argument \spad{x2},{} is the final point,{} and \spad{ns},{} the number of steps to take. \blankline \item \spad{rk4qc(y,{} n,{} x1,{} step,{} eps,{} yscal,{} derivs)} takes a 5-th order Runge-Kutta step with monitoring of local truncation to ensure accuracy and adjust stepsize. The function takes two half steps and one full step and scales the difference in solutions at the final point. If the error is within \spad{eps},{} the step is taken and the result is returned. If the error is not within \spad{eps},{} the stepsize if decreased and the procedure is tried again until the desired accuracy is reached. Upon input,{} an trial step size must be given and upon return,{} an estimate of the next step size to use is returned as well as the step size which produced the desired accuracy. The scaled error is computed as \centerline{\spad{error = MAX(ABS((y2steps(i) - y1step(i))/yscal(i)))}} and this is compared against \spad{eps}. If this is greater than \spad{eps},{} the step size is reduced accordingly to \centerline{\spad{hnew = 0.9 * hdid * (error/eps)^(-1/4)}} If the error criterion is satisfied,{} then we check if the step size was too fine and return a more efficient one.

1033184`This suite of routines performs numerical quadrature using algorithms derived from the basic trapezoidal rule.

For the \spad{i}\spad{-}th level,{} this is an appropriate combination of all the previous trapezodial estimates so that the error term starts with the \spad{2*(i+1)} power only. \par The three families come in a closed version,{} where the formulas include the endpoints,{} an open version where the formulas do not include the endpoints and an adaptive version,{} where the user is required to input the number of subintervals over which the appropriate closed family integrator will apply with the usual convergence parameters for each subinterval. This is useful where a large number of points are needed only in a small fraction of the entire domain. \par Each routine takes as arguments: \newline \spad{f}\tab{10} integrand \newline a\tab{10} starting point \newline \spad{b}\tab{10} ending point \newline \spad{eps_r}\tab{10} relative error \newline \spad{eps_a}\tab{10} absolute error \newline \spad{nmin} \tab{10} refinement level when to start checking for convergence (> 1) \newline \spad{nmax} \tab{10} maximum level of refinement \par The adaptive routines take as an additional parameter \newline \spad{nint}\tab{10} the number of independent intervals to apply a closed \indented{1}{family integrator of the same name.} \par Notes: \newline Closed family level \spad{i} uses \spad{1 + 2^i} points. \newline Open family level \spad{i} uses \spad{1 + 3^i} points.

1057090`A package for computing symbolically the complex and real roots of zero-dimensional algebraic systems over the integer or rational numbers. Complex roots are given by means of univariate representations of irreducible regular chains. Real roots are given by means of tuples of coordinates lying in the \spadtype{RealClosure} of the coefficient ring. This constructor takes three arguments.

1058830`\spadtype{DifferentialPolynomialCategory} is a category constructor specifying basic functions in an ordinary differential polynomial ring with a given ordered set of differential indeterminates. In addition,{} it implements defaults for the basic functions. The functions \spadfun{order} and \spadfun{weight} are extended from the set of derivatives of differential indeterminates to the set of differential polynomials. Other operations provided on differential polynomials are \spadfun{leader},{} \spadfun{initial},{} \spadfun{separant},{} \spadfun{differentialVariables},{} and \spadfun{isobaric?}. Furthermore,{} if the ground ring is a differential ring,{} then evaluation (substitution of differential indeterminates by elements of the ground ring or by differential polynomials) is provided by \spadfun{eval}. A convenient way of referencing derivatives is provided by the functions \spadfun{makeVariable}. \blankline To construct a domain using this constructor,{} one needs to provide a ground ring \spad{R},{} an ordered set \spad{S} of differential indeterminates,{} a ranking \spad{V} on the set of derivatives of the differential indeterminates,{} and a set \spad{E} of exponents in bijection with the set of differential monomials in the given differential indeterminates. \blankline

1059091`\spadtype{DifferentialVariableCategory} constructs the set of derivatives of a given set of (ordinary) differential indeterminates. If \spad{x},{} ...,{} \spad{y} is an ordered set of differential indeterminates,{} and the prime notation is used for differentiation,{} then the set of derivatives (including zero-th order) of the differential indeterminates is \spad{x},{} \spad{x'},{} \spad{x''},{} ...,{} \spad{y},{} \spad{y'},{} \spad{y''},{} ... (Note: in the interpreter,{} the \spad{n}-th derivative of \spad{y} is displayed as \spad{y} with a subscript \spad{n}.) This set is viewed as a set of algebraic indeterminates,{} totally ordered in a way compatible with differentiation and the given order on the differential indeterminates. Such a total order is called a ranking of the differential indeterminates. \blankline A domain in this category is needed to construct a differential polynomial domain. Differential polynomials are ordered by a ranking on the derivatives,{} and by an order (extending the ranking) on on the set of differential monomials. One may thus associate a domain in this category with a ranking of the differential indeterminates,{} just as one associates a domain in the category \spadtype{OrderedAbelianMonoidSup} with an ordering of the set of monomials in a set of algebraic indeterminates. The ranking is specified through the binary relation \spadfun{<}. For example,{} one may define one derivative to be less than another by lexicographically comparing first the \spadfun{order},{} then the given order of the differential indeterminates appearing in the derivatives. This is the default implementation. \blankline The notion of weight generalizes that of degree. A polynomial domain may be made into a graded ring if a weight function is given on the set of indeterminates,{} Very often,{} a grading is the first step in ordering the set of monomials. For differential polynomial domains,{} this constructor provides a function \spadfun{weight},{} which allows the assignment of a non-negative number to each derivative of a differential indeterminate. For example,{} one may define the weight of a derivative to be simply its \spadfun{order} (this is the default assignment). This weight function can then be extended to the set of all differential polynomials,{} providing a graded ring structure.

1060380`FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField {\em F} is the category of fields which are finite algebraic extensions of the field {\em F}. If {\em F} is finite then any finite algebraic extension of {\em F} is finite,{} too. Let {\em K} be a finite algebraic extension of the finite field {\em F}. The exponentiation of elements of {\em K} defines a \spad{Z}-module structure on the multiplicative group of {\em K}. The additive group of {\em K} becomes a module over the ring of polynomials over {\em F} via the operation \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a: \spad{K},{} \spad{f:} SparseUnivariatePolynomial \spad{F}) which is linear over {\em F},{} \spadignore{i.e.} for elements {\em a} from {\em K},{} {\em c,{} d} from {\em F} and {\em f,{} g} univariate polynomials over {\em F} we have \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} cf+dg) equals {\em c} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{f}) plus {\em d} times \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} \spad{g}). Therefore \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp} is defined completely by its action on monomials from {\em F[X]}: \spadfun{linearAssociatedExp}(a,{} monomial(1,{} \spad{k})\spad{\$}SUP(\spad{F})) is defined to be \spadfun{Frobenius}(a,{} \spad{k}) which is {\em a^(q^k)} where {\em q=size()\$F}.

In repeated index notation each entry \spad{i} in the index denotes a differentiation with respect to \spad{x^i}. The choice affects,{} however,{} only in- and output. Internally,{} multi-index notation is used throughout.
1063395`\spadtype{JetBundleFunctionCategory} defines the category of functions (local sections) over a jet bundle. The formal derivative is defined already here. It uses the Jacobi matrix of the functions. The columns of the matrices are enumerated by jet variables. Thus they are represented as a \spadtype{Record} of the matrix and a list of the jet variables. Several simplification routines are implemented already here.
1063506`A keyed dictionary is a dictionary of key-entry pairs for which there is a unique entry for each key.
1063611`LazyStreamAggregate is the category of streams with lazy evaluation. It is understood that the function 'empty?' will cause lazy evaluation if necessary to determine if there are entries. Functions which call 'empty?',{} \spadignore{e.g.} 'first' and 'rest',{} will also cause lazy evaluation if necessary. Elements of LazyStreamAggregate are computed only when strictly needed. Lazy computation means that potential errors are delayed,{} so errors are detected later than in case of normal (eager) evaluation used by other aggregates. In some cases computation that would signal error when using eager evaluation can succeed when using lazy evaluation.

1063842`A linear aggregate is an aggregate whose elements are indexed by integers. Examples of linear aggregates are strings,{} lists,{} and arrays. Most of the exported operations for linear aggregates are non-destructive but are not always efficient for a particular aggregate. For example,{} \spadfun{concat} of two lists needs only to copy its first argument,{} whereas \spadfun{concat} of two arrays needs to copy both arguments. Most of the operations exported here apply to infinite objects (\spadignore{e.g.} streams) as well to finite ones. If the aggregate is a finite aggregate then it has several additional exports such as \spadfun{reverse},{} \spadfun{sort},{} and so on.

1064270`\spadtype{MatrixCategory} is a general matrix category which allows different representations and indexing schemes. Rows and columns may be extracted with rows returned as objects of type Row and columns returned as objects of type Col. A domain belonging to this category will be shallowly mutable. The index of the 'first' row may be obtained by calling the function \spadfun{minRowIndex}. The index of the 'first' column may be obtained by calling the function \spadfun{minColIndex}. The index of the first element of a Row is the same as the index of the first column in a matrix and vice versa.

1065349`One-dimensional-array aggregates serves as models for one-dimensional arrays. Categorically,{} these aggregates are finite linear aggregates with the \spadtype{shallowlyMutable} property,{} that is,{} any component of the array may be changed without affecting the identity of the overall array. Array data structures are typically represented by a fixed area in storage and therefore cannot efficiently grow or shrink on demand as can list structures (see however \spadtype{FlexibleArray} for a data structure which is a cross between a list and an array). Iteration over,{} and access to,{} elements of arrays is extremely fast (and often can be optimized to open-code). Insertion and deletion however is generally slow since an entirely new data structure must be created for the result.

1066026`A category for finite subsets of a polynomial ring. Such a set is only regarded as a set of polynomials and not identified to the ideal it generates. So two distinct sets may generate the same the ideal. Furthermore,{} for \spad{R} being an integral domain,{} a set of polynomials may be viewed as a representation of the ideal it generates in the polynomial ring \spad{(R)^(-1) P},{} or the set of its zeros (described for instance by the radical of the previous ideal,{} or a split of the associated affine variety) and so on. So this category provides operations about those different notions.

Recursively,{} a recursive aggregate is either empty or a {\em node} consisting of a \spadfun{value} from \spad{S} and 0 or more \spadfun{children} which are also nodes.

1067510`The category of regular triangular sets,{} introduced under the name regular chains in [1] (and other papers). In [3] it is proved that regular triangular sets and towers of simple extensions of a field are equivalent notions. In the following definitions,{} all polynomials and ideals are taken from the polynomial ring \spad{k[x1,{} ...,{} xn]} where \spad{k} is the fraction field of \spad{R}. The triangular set \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} tm]} is regular iff for every \spad{i} the initial of \spad{ti+1} is invertible in the tower of simple extensions associated with \spad{[t1,{} ...,{} \spad{ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given ideal \spad{I} iff the radical of \spad{I} is equal to the intersection of the radical ideals generated by the saturated ideals of the \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} \spad{Ti}]}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Kalkbrener of a given triangular set \spad{T} iff it is a split of Kalkbrener of the saturated ideal of \spad{T}. Let \spad{K} be an algebraic closure of \spad{k}. Assume that \spad{V} is finite with cardinality \spad{n} and let \spad{A} be the affine space \spad{K^n}. For a regular triangular set \spad{T} let denote by \spad{W(T)} the set of regular zeros of \spad{T}. A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given subset \spad{S} of \spad{A} iff the union of the \spad{W(\spad{Ti})} contains \spad{S} and is contained in the closure of \spad{S} (\spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. Zariski topology). A family \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} of regular triangular sets is a split of Lazard of a given triangular set \spad{T} if it is a split of Lazard of \spad{W(T)}. Note that if \spad{[T1,{} ...,{} Ts]} is a split of Lazard of \spad{T} then it is also a split of Kalkbrener of \spad{T}. The converse is \spad{false}. This category provides operations related to both kinds of splits,{} the former being related to ideals decomposition whereas the latter deals with varieties decomposition. See the example illustrating the \spadtype{RegularTriangularSet} constructor for more explanations about decompositions by means of regular triangular sets. \newline

1067897`A set category lists a collection of set-theoretic operations useful for both finite sets and multisets. Note however that finite sets are distinct from multisets.

1068032`PointCategory is the category of points and vectors in space. Points may be used to represent shapes in a scenegraph such as: the vertices of a cube or points along a line.

1069065`The category of triangular sets of multivariate polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain. Let \spad{R} be an integral domain and \spad{V} a finite ordered set of variables,{} say \spad{X1 < X2 < ... < Xn}. A set \spad{S} of polynomials in \spad{R[X1,{} X2,{} ...,{} Xn]} is triangular if no elements of \spad{S} lies in \spad{R},{} and if two distinct elements of \spad{S} have distinct main variables. Note that the empty set is a triangular set. A triangular set is not necessarily a (lexicographical) Groebner basis and the notion of reduction related to triangular sets is based on the recursive view of polynomials. We recall this notion here and refer to [1] for more details. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a non-constant polynomial \spad{Q} if the degree of \spad{P} in the main variable of \spad{Q} is less than the main degree of \spad{Q}. A polynomial \spad{P} is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t} a triangular set \spad{T} if it is reduced \spad{w}.\spad{r}.\spad{t}. every polynomial of \spad{T}. \newline

The index of the first element of a 'Row' is the same as the index of the first column in an array and vice versa.
1069529`A unary-recursive aggregate is an aggregate where nodes may have either 0 or 1 children. This aggregate models,{} though not precisely,{} a linked list possibly with a single cycle.
